The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said the layoffs started in recent days and amount to roughly 5% of the Gap's 8,700 corporate employees. News of the layoffs comes a few months after the Gap reported weak first quarter earnings, with sales sliding at its flagship brand and its more popular Old Navy chain. In July, the company announced that CEO Sonia Syngal would step down after less than three years. She will be replaced by an interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent leader.Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, wrote in an analyst note that the job cuts \"make sense\" because of the company's slowing sales and shrinking retail footprint. He added that Old Navy is no longer as strong as it had been in boosting the Gap's bottom line. \"Traditionally, Gap could rely on its Old Navy banner to cover some of the sluggishness in other parts of the business. However, with the division suffering from supply chain issues and softening demand from the family segment, the whole company is very exposed and needs to take tougher actions to appease investors and present better numbers over the second half of the year,\" Saunders wrote.

Now, one day after the monarch's funeral, strikes are back on as workers press their claims for better pay and conditions and annual inflation hovers around 10%.Earlier this month, rail and postal worker unions paused plans to walk out over demands for higher pay in the wake of the Queen's death. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said Tuesday that more than 40,000 workers spanning 14 train operators and Network Rail, the owner of the national railway infrastructure, would strike for 24 hours starting on October 1 in a dispute over pay, job security and conditions.  The RMT said the action \u2014 which will coincide with separate strikes by other rail staff and bus workers \u2014 would bring Britain's railways to an \"effective standstill.\"Read More\"Transport workers are joining a wave of strike action on October 1st, sending a clear message to the government and employers that working people will not accept continued attacks on pay and working conditions at a time when big business profits are at an all-time high,\" RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said in a statement. Jubilee line trains parked at the London Underground Stratford Market Depot in London, as London Underground workers joined members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union in their nationwide strike in a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. Picture date: Tuesday June 21, 2022. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)Since June, RMT members have walked out for a total of six days over the same demands, joining thousands of UK workers \u2014 including journalists, lawyers and call center workers \u2014 who have downed tools as they struggle with the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Average wages have failed to keep pace with soaring consumer price inflation, which stood at 9.9% in the year to August. More strikes could be on the way this fall, threatening unprecedented disruption across a range of industries. Teachers, doctors and nurses are set to vote on strike action in the coming weeks. More unions could even coordinate their walkouts. Unite and Unison \u2014 the country's biggest unions with 2.7 million members in total \u2014 are calling for others to join them in synchronized action.Last week, Unite said that 1,900 workers at Britain's biggest container port Felixstowe will strike for eight days starting September 27 over pay for the second time in as many months. The walkout will overlap with strike action by hundreds of dockworkers at the Port of Liverpool, another key UK trade hub. In the United States, too, workers are unhappy. Last week, the country narrowly averted a rail strike by more than 50,000 workers after unions and railroad companies came to a tentative deal over pay. The strike had threatened to cripple supply chains and push prices higher for many goods. \u2014 Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich and Jeremy Diamond contributed reporting.

These codes show where people make purchases but don't detail what they specifically bought.The GOP letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, argues the new code for gun stores is the result of \"transnational collusion between large corporations leveraging their market power to further their owners' desired social outcomes.\"The Republican officials, led by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, argue the effort will result in \"vague and misleading\" information.\"This categorization would not recognize the difference, for example, between the purchase of a gun safe and a fire arm,\" the officials wrote, adding that gun purchases at department stores would not be captured.However, the credit card companies have said they will continue to support lawful purchases and that won't change by adopting the new standards. In other words, legal gun purchases won't be blocked by this new merchant category code, or MCC.\"We do not believe private companies should serve as moral arbiters,\" Visa said in a blog post last week. \"Asking private companies to decide what legal products or services can or cannot be bought and from what store sets a dangerous precedent.\"Visa added that its network doesn't allow financial institution members to deny transactions for the purchase of legal goods or services based on what merchant code they fall under.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/20/business/gun-sales-mastercard-visa/index.html", "title": "GOP attorneys general threaten Visa, American Express and MasterCard over gun-store code"}, {"authors": "By Angela Dewan, CNN Business", "date_publish": "Updated 1323 GMT (2123 HKT) September 20, 2022 ", "description": "Tax fossil fuel companies 'feasting' on profits as 'planet burns' and power bills soar, UN chief urgesBy Angela Dewan, CNN BusinessUpdated 1323 GMT (2123 HKT) September 20, 2022 UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "CNN", "maintext": "Tax fossil fuel companies 'feasting' on profits as 'planet burns' and power bills soar, UN chief urgesBy Angela Dewan, CNN BusinessUpdated 1323 GMT (2123 HKT) September 20, 2022 UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.London (CNN Business)Rich economies should hit oil and gas companies with new windfall taxes to provide help for countries suffering from climate change, and people struggling with soaring energy and food bills, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Tuesday.The UN chief accused energy giants of \"feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns.\"Guterres' comments, at the UN General Assembly in New York, come on the heels of a European Union proposal to introduce a windfall tax on oil, gas and coal companies, many of which have reported record-high profits as Russia's war in Ukraine and an energy crunch send prices soaring.The European Commission is proposing that EU states take a 33% share of the companies' surplus profits. The United Kingdom introduced a 25% windfall tax earlier this year to provide relief for people struggling with their energy bills but newly installed Prime Minister Liz Truss has said she won't extend it to pay for a much bigger program of subsidies this winter and next. US President Joe Biden's administration mulled the idea in the summer but it gained little momentum.\"Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\" Guterres told the Assembly. \"Those funds should be redirected in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis, and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\"Read MoreHis comments also come as parts of the world are battered by extreme weather events supercharged by the human-induced climate crisis. More than 1,500 people died in Pakistan over three months of extreme monsoonal rain that scientists have linked to climate change. More than 300 people have died in floods in Nigeria this year, disaster management authorities there say.Typhoons and hurricanes have brought floods to Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Japan this week. Drought is impacting vast swathes of the United States, China and Europe.Record profits, rising inequalityGuterres warned that a \"winter of global discontent is on the horizon,\" with inequality \"exploding\" and the cost-of-living crisis \"raging\" while the planet burns.\"We need to hold fossil fuel companies and their enablers to account,\" he added. \"That includes the banks, private equity, asset managers and other financial institutions that continue to invest and underwrite carbon pollution.\"Norway's $1.2 trillion fund sets 2050 net zero target In the second quarter this year, oil and gas giant Shell (RDSA) earned record profits of $11.5 billion, breaking its previous record posted just three months earlier. ExxonMobil (XOM) also broke its record in the same period, with $17.9 billion, nearly double what it made in its very profitable first quarter. BP's (BP) profits hit a 14-year high of $8.45 billion.The UN General Assembly is likely to be dominated by Russia's war in Ukraine. The climate crisis, nonetheless, will be unavoidable, intersecting with several issues on the agenda, including energy and food security.\"The climate crisis is the defining issue of our time,\" Guterres said. \"And it must be the first priority of every government and multilateral organization. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner -- despite overwhelming public support around the world.\" ", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/20/energy/energy-climate-windfall-tax-unga-intl/index.html", "title": "Tax fossil fuel companies 'feasting' on profits as 'planet burns' and power bills soar, UN chief urges"}, {"authors": "By Jennifer Korn, CNN Business", "date_publish": "Updated 1626 GMT (0026 HKT) September 20, 2022 ", "description": "Crypto firm Wintermute hit by $160 million theftBy Jennifer Korn, CNN BusinessUpdated 1626 GMT (0026 HKT) September 20, 2022 JUST WATCHEDThe Ethereum merge, explainedReplayMore Videos ", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "CNN", "maintext": "Crypto firm Wintermute hit by $160 million theftBy Jennifer Korn, CNN BusinessUpdated 1626 GMT (0026 HKT) September 20, 2022 JUST WATCHEDThe Ethereum merge, explainedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)The Ethereum merge, explainedYou can now edit and unsend iMessages.

The incident marks the latest in a growing list of large crypto thefts this year.The hack is said to have targeted Wintermute's decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, according to a series of tweets Tuesday from the company's founder and CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy.Report: $1.9 billion stolen in crypto hacks so far this yearDeFi services, a newer part of the crypto world, cut out centralized exchanges and are based mainly on Ethereum blockchain technology. These services are viewed as \"uniquely vulnerable to hacking,\" according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, due to their open source code, large pools of assets and rapid growth that may have led to a lapse in security best practices in some cases.In the first seven months of 2022, a staggering $1.9 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in hacks of various services, marking a 60% increase from the same period in the year prior, according to a report released from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis last month.Some of the biggest crypto hacks of the year so far were on DeFi protocols, including the $625 million hack in March of a gaming-focused blockchain network that supports the popular video game Axie Infinity. Some of these thefts, including the Axie incident, have since been attributed to hackers associated with North Korea. Wintermute has not provided any indication of who may be behind the theft.Read MoreIn his tweets Tuesday, Gaevoy assured customers that Wintermute is still \"solvent with twice over\" the $160 million stolen left in remaining equity.Wintermute, founded in 2017 by Gaevoy, refers to itself as a \"leading\" digital asset market maker. It has provided liquidity on more than 50 exchanges and crypto platforms.Users were warned that there could be service disruption over the next several days. \"If you are a lender to Wintermute, again, we are solvent, but if you feel safer to recall the loan, we can absolutely do that,\" Gaevoy tweeted.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/20/tech/wintermute-crypto-hack/index.html", "title": "Crypto firm Wintermute hit by $160 million theft"}, {"authors": "By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business", "date_publish": "Updated 1839 GMT (0239 HKT) September 20, 2022 ", "description": "Walmart and Target push to lower credit card feesBy Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN BusinessUpdated 1839 GMT (0239 HKT) September 20, 2022 JUST WATCHEDYellen: Rising gas prices are a 'risk' this winterReplayMore Videos ", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "CNN", "maintext": "Walmart and Target push to lower credit card feesBy Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN BusinessUpdated 1839 GMT (0239 HKT) September 20, 2022 JUST WATCHEDYellen: Rising gas prices are a 'risk' this winterReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHYellen: Rising gas prices are a 'risk' this winter 01:29New York (CNN Business)Frustrated by extra credit card fees when you shop?A pair of bipartisan bills in Congress aim to lower the swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, that retailers pay every time a customer makes a purchase with their card. The effort is backed by retail giants including Walmart, (WMT) Target (TGT), and Kroger (KR), as well as convenience stores and independent grocers.\"Swipe fees for credit cards are higher in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized world \u2014 more than seven times as high as Europe,\" a coalition of businesses wrote in a letter to lawmakers last week. \"They are an inflation multiplier.\"Dollar General's newest shoppers: People making $100,000 a yearInterchange fees are applied via a complex system, and the charges vary by merchant, transaction size, the type of card used and the banking institution, among other factors. Merchants paid about $138 billion in processing fees last year, according to the Nilson Report, a publication covering the payment industry. These fees usually run between 1% and 3% of a transaction's final price, and stores often pass them on to customers in the form of higher prices. Read MoreVisa (V) and Mastercard (MA) dominate more than 80% of the US credit card market. In July, US Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Roger Marshall of Kansas introduced legislation that would allow businesses to route many payments to alternate networks not run by Visa or Mastercard. This week, US Reps. Peter Welch of Vermont and Lance Gooden of Texas proposed a similar measure.Proponents of these bills say they would generate more competition in the credit card network market and break Visa and Mastercard's hold over the industry.\"Credit card swipe fees inflate the prices that consumers pay for groceries and gas,\" Durbin said in July. \"Bringing real competition to credit card networks will help reduce swipe fees and hold down costs for Main Street merchants and their customers.\"Visa and Mastercard say the fees help fund rewards programs and banking services and help lower risks for merchants by guaranteeing payment regardless of fraud or whether the customer pays their credit card bill.Credit card companies say the legislation would not lower prices for consumers and would instead lead to unintended consequences such as fewer rewards, less access to credit and risks to data security.\"This legislation would again boost retailers' bottom lines at the expense of everyday Americans \u2014 stripping them of their credit card rewards and usurping their choice of network,\" said Jeff Tassey, chairman of the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card issuers and networks.Additionally, there are concerns that credit cards could become more expensive and less attainable for some consumers. Some credit unions that serve under-banked communities are concerned the legislation could limit customers' access to credit, said Deshundra Jefferson, a spokesperson for the Credit Union National Association.CNN Business' Alicia Wallace contributed to this article.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/20/business/credit-card-fees-visa-mastercard-retail/index.html", "title": "Walmart and Target push to lower credit card fees"}, {"authors": "By Michelle Toh, CNN Business", "date_publish": "Updated 1334 GMT (2134 HKT) September 20, 2022 ", "description": "", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "CNN", "maintext": "", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/20/investing/hsbc-wealth-ceo-global-inflation-strategy-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Inflation is stubbornly high.

According to the company's latest filing with the Mumbai stock exchange, \"the promoter and promoter group\" \u2014 which includes Ambani's wife and children as well as several associated companies \u2014 control nearly 51% of the conglomerate.\"Our next-gen leaders are confidently taking over the reins across businesses,\" Asia's second richest man said at the meeting. While Ambani inherited an oil business from his father two decades ago, he has spent the last few years diversifying into tech, renewable energy and retail. He launched Reliance Jio as a mobile network in 2016. Since then it has amassed over 400 million users and launched a streaming service, a fiber broadband network, a video conferencing app and digital payments.Read MoreReliance Industries is now worth 17.8 trillion rupees ($224 billion), based on its stock market value.\"Akash and Isha have assumed leadership roles in Jio and Retail respectively. They have been passionately involved in our consumer businesses since inception,\" Ambani said. \"Anant has also joined our New Energy business with great zeal.\"Reliance Retail, which was launched in 2006, is India's top retailer by revenue and has over 15,000 stores across the country. They sell everything from smartphones to groceries through various eponymous brands, including Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital and Reliance Trends. Ambani is the 11th richest man in the world with a fortune of over $90 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The tycoon said Monday that he isn't retiring yet, and will \"continue to provide hands-on leadership.\"While there has been a lot of speculation in India media about who will inherit Ambani's empire, this is the first time he has made an official statement on the roles his children will play during the transition. Bitter feudAmbani's father, Dhirubhai, died in 2002 without a will. His death sparked a bitter feud between Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, for control of the empire.Mukesh Ambani ultimately took over the company's main oil and petrochemicals assets, while his brother assumed control of the newer ventures, including telecom and digital businesses. The brothers' fortunes have gone in vastly different directions since then. Anil, once a billionaire, is no longer part of the elite club, according to the Bloomberg index, and his older brother played a big part in his demise.Mukesh stunned India with the Jio launch, offering customers six months of free high-speed internet. The move triggered a brutal price war, forcing some companies to quit the market altogether, including Anil's Reliance Communications.On Monday, Ambani told shareholders that Jio will invest $25 billion to roll out 5G services across India.\"5G cannot remain an exclusive service, available only to the privileged few, or only to those in our largest cities,\" he said. \"Within the next two months, by Diwali, we will launch Jio 5G across multiple key cities, including the metropolises of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai,\" he said, referring to the Hindu festival in October. The company is also working with Google (GOOGL) to develop \"ultra-affordable 5G smartphones for India,\" Ambani said. Last year, the two companies introduced an entry-level 4G phone in the country. Since inception, Jio \u2014 with its super-cheap data \u2014 has helped bring hundreds of millions of Indians online for the first time. When Ambani launched Jio, India had fewer than 350 million internet users. Now, it has over 750 million.\"We are committed to make India the largest data-powered economy in the world, beating China and the United States,\" Ambani said.On energy, Ambani said that \"Reliance aspires to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing and a credible alternative to China,\" and plans to invest nearly $10 billion into clean energy manufacturing.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/30/business/mukesh-ambani-reliance-succession-plan-india-hnk-intl/index.html", "title": "Mukesh Ambani prepares to hand a $220 billion empire to his children"}, {"authors": "By Diksha Madhok, CNN Business", "date_publish": "Updated 0838 GMT (1638 HKT) November 4, 2021", "description": "JUST WATCHEDHe made a $1 billion bet on an unproven Covid-19 vaccineReplayMore Videos ", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "CNN", "maintext": "JUST WATCHEDHe made a $1 billion bet on an unproven Covid-19 vaccineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)He made a $1 billion bet on an unproven Covid-19 vaccineThis is how fraudsters peddled counterfeit Covid tests and masksSee airline passengers throw away masks as mandate is revokedSee Dr. Gupta's reaction to judge ending mask mandateWhite House miffed by press corps' Covid coverage?Fox anchor says the Covid-19 vaccine saved his lifeThis home was built for the next pandemic.

That vaccine, created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN), was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. Read MoreAs the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. \"It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccineBut soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. From horse breeders to vaccine makersIt's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said.Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. India's Covid-19 tsunamiBut Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.\"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\"The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Being held to accountWhile Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.\"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it \"very unreasonable and naive\" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \"philanthropic gesture\" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.\"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/02/business/adar-poonawalla-risk-takers/index.html", "title": "India's billionaire vaccine prince held the key to ending the pandemic.

These allegations are part of the broad, nearly 200-page disclosure that Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko submitted to US regulators and lawmakers last month, which was first reported Tuesday by CNN and the Washington Post. The disclosure alleges that Twitter is rife with security and privacy vulnerabilities that put users, investors and even US national security at risk, and that Twitter executives have misled its board and regulators about its shortcomings. (Twitter has broadly defended itself against Zatko's allegations and claimed the disclosure contains \"inconsistencies and inaccuracies.\") The disclosure sounds the alarm about a platform that has become a hub for information-sharing among influential voices \u2014 including media, celebrities, academics, government officials and world leaders \u2014 and which many people consider to be crucial to democracy. As such, the platform is also a key target for bad actors whom experts say could wreak havoc on elections and civic processes. Twitter has previously come under fire for enabling the spread of misinformation that led to real-world civic harms, including in the run-up to the January 6 Capitol insurrection.  Members of the US House Committee on Homeland Security on Thursday sent Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal a letter demanding that he address Zatko's allegations and explain Twitter's readiness for the 2022 midterms. \"Twitter plays a unique role in our information and political ecosystems.  Security flaws that put users' sensitive personal data within easy reach of a hacker looking to take control of a high-profile account or a foreign dictator looking for information on dissidents are nothing short of a threat to national security,\" Rep. Bennie Thompson and Rep. Yvette Clark, chairs of the Committee on Homeland Security and the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, & Innovation, respectively, said in the letter.  Ex-Twitter exec blows the whistle, alleging reckless and negligent cybersecurity policies\"For the past eight to ten years, Twitter has been very important, for better and worse, for our politics,\" said Paul Barrett, adjunct professor at NYU Law School and deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Read MoreIn 2020, hackers tricked Twitter employees into handing over internal access that allowed them to take over the accounts of prominent figures such as former President Barack Obama and then-Presidential candidate Joe Biden. The hackers were carrying out a cryptocurrency scam, but many experts raised alarms about what could have happened if they'd been politically motivated. Zatko claims the company remains vulnerable to a similar hack, although Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools and that the company has since improved security controls.  Twitter earlier this month said it had activated its policies for safeguarding its platform ahead of the upcoming US midterm elections, plans that include labeling and reducing the spread of misinformation. The company also pushes reliable information to users, including localized election information; labels candidates for US House, US Senate and governor; trains state and local election officials about how to use the platform; and says it enforces at scale its rules, such as those prohibiting harassment, spam and manipulated media. And on Thursday, the company confirmed to CNN that it will combine its teams working to prevent toxic content and spam bots, in order to better fight bad actors and increase transparency around its efforts to improve platform health, a move first reported by Reuters Wednesday. But the disclosure calls into question Twitter's ability to effectively enact and enforce such plans and policies. The disclosure also alleges that Twitter, like other social platforms, may be even less prepared to address election-related threats in other countries, where Zatko claims it often lacks the appropriate resources and language and regional expertise.  Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, Twitter's former head of security, has filed a whistleblower disclosure accusing the company of serious security and privacy vulnerabilities. Zatko \u2014 a former ethical hacker who was part of the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity in the 1990s and who spent time working for the US Department of Defense prior to Twitter \u2014 told CNN that he took the job at the social media company, where he was given a broad mandate to address its security issues before being fired earlier this year, in large part because of its important role in civic discourse. \"This is a global platform that gives a voice to everybody, their mission is to serve the public conversation and to improve the health of the public conversation,\" Zatko said in an interview. He added: \"I still do think Twitter is that important, and it has the ability to do a tremendous amount of good in the world.\" A Twitter spokesperson told CNN in a statement Tuesday responding to the disclosure that Zatko was fired for \"ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" The spokesperson said the disclosure presents a \"false narrative\" about the company and is \"riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" On Thursday, the spokesperson said the company has \"a cross-functional team around the globe that's focused on curbing the spread of misinformation and fostering an environment conducive to healthy, meaningful conversation on Twitter. We're always working to improve the safety of our service \u2014 from strategic investments in machine learning, to building our policies around misinformation in public, over the last years, we have significantly improved our capacity to keep people safe on Twitter.\" Challenges addressing harmful contentEarly in his tenure, Zatko hired a third-party consulting firm to conduct a review of Twitter's efforts to combat mis- and disinformation, spam and bad actors, as well as to promote overall platform integrity, according to the disclosure. The firm interviewed a dozen employees from Twitter's Trust and Safety, Twitter Services, and Product and Engineering teams, and reviewed the company's mis- and disinformation tools and processes and 19 internal documents, retrospectives and training guides. It found that Twitter's policies are typically developed in reaction to crises, rather than proactively, and that the company is \"constantly behind the curve in actioning against disinformation and misinformation,\" according to a draft copy of the report included in Zatko's disclosure.  The report pointed to a range of organizational challenges to effectively responding to misinformation and platform manipulation, including the fact that mis- and disinformation are handled by different teams and that other parts of the company that assist in responding to such issues, such as the events and trending curation teams, have only informal relationships with the site integrity teams. It also claims that product teams are incentivized to launch new products as quickly as possible and \"thus are willing to accept security risks.\"  Twitter lacks adequate staffing to address misinformation risks, the firm's report claims. For example, it notes that Twitter did not bring on a team member to focus on misinformation until 2019 and, as of the report's completion in mid-2021, the company had only two misinformation subject matter experts on the site integrity team.  \"Understaffing has meant that the teams across Twitter working on the misinformation and disinformation problem have had to make significant tradeoffs, especially during critical events and surges,\" the report states. The report also criticized the company's lack of staff with appropriate knowledge to respond to threats and misinformation. It states that content moderation is outsourced mostly to vendors in Manila, and that moderators often \"do not have the geographic expertise or language capabilities to understand important cultural or linguistic context, and therefore are not able to make accurate and consistent decisions on what is misinformation.\" It adds that, at the time of the report's publication, Twitter had only one information operations staff member each with expertise in China, Russia and Iran. \"It's hard from the outside to prescribe exactly how a company should organize itself but the consultants clearly concluded that the haphazard way that twitter is organized ends up with siloed relationships between employees that slows things down and does not create incentives for people to come together and coalesce around a problem,\" Barrett said. Twitter activates election policy enforcement for US midtermsTwitter's spokesperson said the report does not \"represent the platform as it exists today, nor do the reports capture our important and ongoing efforts to refine our approach to curbing misinformation and disinformation on Twitter.\" The spokesperson added that the company's policies address content in four areas \u2014 civic integrity, synthetic or manipulated media, Covid-19 misinformation and crisis misinformation \u2014 and prioritizes removing content that could cause immediate harm. After the third-party firm's report was complete, Twitter executives went behind Zatko's back to ask the firm to have its results scrubbed by lawyers to remove \"factual information that would be especially embarrassing to Twitter\" for fear of the \"impact on Twitter's reputation were the findings to become publicly known,\" his disclosure alleges. Twitter did not respond to questions from CNN about the allegation that its executives had the report altered.  Risks of foreign interference and rogue insidersTwitter's lax security practices also make it vulnerable to more direct forms of foreign interference and manipulation that could harm US interests and national security, according to the disclosure. \"If Russia, because of the incredibly high tensions created by the Ukraine invasion, seeks to lash out at the US by mucking up our midterm elections, one way they could do that is by hacking into Twitter, taking over accounts of prominent people, having them say divisive things and creating chaos the way Russians have shown they like to do,\" Barrett said.  Zatko's disclosure alleges that nearly half of the company's employees have access to the \"production environment\" where changes to the platform can be made, and that Twitter employees frequently have access to more sensitive data than they need to do their jobs, such as user contact information. That, he claims, opens the door for bad actors (through phishing attacks or other hacks) or disgruntled employees to more easily access sensitive user data or manipulate the platform.  Members of the House Committee on Homeland Security have asked Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal about Twitter's ability to address threats related to the 2022 midterm elections following the whistleblower disclosure.During the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, for instance, Zatko says in the disclosure that he became concerned that a Twitter employee who sympathized with the insurrectionists could manipulate the company's platform, according to the disclosure. But, the disclosure says that Zatko soon learned \"it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did.\" Chris Lehman, CEO of social media cybersecurity firm SafeGuard Cyber told CNN that if half of a company's employees have access to its live production environment, \"it creates a huge opening into what we call insider threats.\" Insiders, whether knowingly or not, could be targeted by bad actors to gain access to prominent users' accounts \u2014 similar to Twitter's major 2020 hack \u2014 or to gather information about how to game the platform to further their agenda.  The whistleblower disclosure also alleges that \"while it was against policy\" employees commonly installed third-party software on their work devices with little oversight.  \"Twitter employees were repeatedly found to be intentionally installing spyware on their work computers at the request of external organizations,\" the disclosure states. \"It was repeatedly demonstrated that until Twitter leadership would stumble across end-point (employee computer) problems, external people or organizations had more awareness of activity on some Twitter employee computers than Twitter itself had.\" (It is not clear how many employees may have been involved in spyware incidents.) Twitter is vulnerable to Russian and Chinese influence, whistleblower saysTwitter said members of its engineering and product teams are authorized to access Twitter's platform if they have a specific business justification for doing so, but that members of other departments \u2014 such as finance, legal, marketing, sales, human resources and support \u2014 cannot. The company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter's live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements. Twitter's employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added. The disclosure also claims that shortly before Zatko was fired from Twitter in January, the US government gave Twitter a specific tip that one or more of its employees was working for a foreign intelligence agency. It's not clear whether the tip was credible, or if Twitter has acted on the information. But if true it would not be the first time: The disclosure is being made public just days after a jury convicted a former Twitter employee of spying for Saudi Arabia. That incident, which was uncovered in 2019, predates the tip described in the disclosure. Twitter did not respond to Zatko's allegations about the US government tip. \"In a business such as Twitter, which is basically ... for better or worse, it is now the town square, and it's where opinions are exchanged, I would expect that in a business that has such huge influence over public opinion and events like an election, you would want to have tight controls to make sure that there's no rogue behavior going on by insiders or bad deeds being committed by outside parties,\" Lehman said.

You can get a refund without applying if your payments brought your loan balance below the maximum debt relief amount: $10,000 for all borrowers, and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers can check their balance in their studentaid.gov account.For example, if a borrower paid $100 a month for 10 months of the pandemic and their balance is now $8,000, that $1,000 will automatically be refunded. Then they can apply to get the rest of their debt forgiven.But if a borrower paid throughout the pandemic and still owes $14,000, they won\u2019t get an automatic refund. They can, however, apply to have $10,000 of that debt erased.Advertisement\n\nAnother group of people that has to apply for a refund is those who completely paid off their loan balance during the pandemic. If that\u2019s you, you\u2019re eligible for loan forgiveness, but you\u2019ll have to request a refund prior to applying for debt relief. Borrowers should confirm their eligibility for the loan forgiveness program prior to requesting a refund.For example, if a borrower had $5,000 in debt at the start of the pandemic and paid it all back during the freeze, but is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness, they would apply for a $5,000 refund, then apply to have their debt forgiven.\u201cBorrowers who paid off their loans during the pause will need to request a refund first, then request cancellation,\u201d said a spokesperson from the Department of Education.The refund is not available for private student loans.Eligible federal student loans:\u2014Direct Loans (defaulted and non defaulted)\u2014Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans held by ED (defaulted and non defaulted)\u2014Federal Perkins Loans held by ED (defaulted and non defaulted)\u2014Defaulted FFEL Program loans not held by ED\u2014Defaulted HEAL loansIf you are not sure which loan you have, visit your dashboard at studentaid.gov and find the \u201cmy loan servicers\u201d section. If you can\u2019t access your dashboard, you can call the Federal Student Aid office at 1-800-433-3243 to ask for loan servicer information.How Can I Apply For A Refund?Borrowers who want a specific amount refunded can apply by calling their loan service provider. Right now, refunds are only being done via phone and not through any website or email.Advertisement\n\nWhen the Biden Administration announced the forgiveness, loan servicers found themselves inundated with calls. But many borrowers now say they\u2019re not waiting long when calling.\u201cI was on hold for about five minutes,\u201d said Megan McParland, of New Jersey, who graduated in 2018 and made several payments during the payment freeze.McParland requested a refund the first week of September. At first, she felt the servicer tried to dissuade her from making the request. But after confirming that she wanted to proceed, she was told that she would see her refund in about a month.Sierra Tibbs, a 47-year-old resident of Casselberry, Florida, had a similar experience. The entire phone call with her loan servicer took around 20 minutes.Tibbs applied for a refund after seeing a video online informing her that she could get back money she paid during the pandemic.Advertisement\n\nIf you are unsure who services your loan, or if the servicer changed during the pandemic, visit your student aid account dashboard and scroll to \u201cmy loan servicers\u201d or call 1-800-433-3243.Before calling your loan provider to request your refund, you need to know your account number and the amount you want refunded.\u2014Loan servicers\u2019 phone numbers:FedLoan Servicing: 1-800-699-2908Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc.: 1-800-236-4300Edfinancial: 1-855-337-6884MOHELA: 1-888-866-4352Aidvantage: 1-800-722-1300Nelnet: 1-888-486-4722OSLA Servicing: 1-866-264-9762ECSI: 1-866-313-3797Default Resolution Group: 1-800-621-3115 (1-877-825-9923 for the deaf or hard of hearing)How Will The Refund Work \u2014 And When Will My Loans Be Forgiven?When you request a refund, the amount that you have paid during the payment freeze will be added back to your student loan balance, said Katherine Welbeck, Civil Rights Counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center.That amount is still eligible for cancellation and can be eliminated after you apply for forgiveness.You\u2019re eligible for debt relief if you had an annual federal income below $125,000 individually or $250,000 if you\u2019re married or head of household in 2020 or 2021. The application is expected to open in early October and you can apply until Dec. 31, 2023.Advertisement\n\nIt is unclear when borrowers will see debt relief. So far, the plan only mentions borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when their debt is forgiven. There is also a possibility that forgiveness could be delayed if the Biden administration faces legal challenges.Laura Baum, a 30-year-old resident of Chicago, paid $5,000 during the payment freeze toward her $15,000 remaining debt. She is eligible to have $20,000 canceled since she was a Pell grant recipient when she was an undergraduate. At the beginning of September, Baum called her loan servicer and asked for a refund.But because of the uncertainty, she is planning to save that money until the Department of Education confirms her debt has been canceled.\u201cI\u2019m going to hold on to that refund until I absolutely see $0 in my student loans,\u201d Baum said.When Is The Deadline To Apply?The deadline to apply for a refund is December 31, 2023. However, Welbeck recommends that you apply for a refund before you apply for debt forgiveness.\u201cIf you apply first, you can process the refund to get your money back, and then that balance in your account is canceled,\u201d Welbeck said.Advertisement\n\nThe application process for loan forgiveness is expected to take four to six weeks.The Department of Education is offering a subscription page where you can sign up to be notified when the application is open.How Much Can I Get Refunded?You can get a refund for the entire amount you paid during the payment freeze, according to the Department of Education. However, you can choose a lower amount.You might pick this option if, during the pandemic, you paid enough to get your debt below the maximum amount of forgiveness. You could get a partial refund, then apply to have your remaining debt wiped out.Say you had $15,000 worth of debt remaining at the beginning of the payment freeze and have since paid $8,000, but qualify for $10,000 in debt relief. You might decide to ask for a refund of just $3,000. Then, your debt balance will be exactly $10,000, and you can apply for maximum loan forgiveness.When Will I Get My Refund?Borrowers should expect to receive their refund six to 12 weeks after requesting it, according to the Department of Education. But you might want to double-check with your loan servicer.Advertisement\n\nMcParland\u2019s loan servicer told her that she should see her refunded amount in 30 to 45 business days, but Baum was told that it would take 60 to 70 business days to see her money back in her bank account.Is The Refund Taxable Income?It is not yet clear if the refunded money will be considered taxable income. Welbeck recommends borrowers check with financial advisers from their own state.Some states, such as Indiana, have already said they will tax debt relief for people who have their student loans canceled. Policies vary from state to state.Does The Refund Affect My Credit Score?Since the Department of Education has not yet announced how the cancellation or refunds will be reported to the credit bureaus, it is still uncertain if these amounts will affect borrowers\u2019 credit scores, said Welbeck.Should I Start Paying Again When The Payment Freeze Ends?The pandemic payment freeze is set to end Dec. 31. If you have not seen debt relief by then, you are still expected to start making payments. Welbeck recommends that borrowers enroll in income-driven repayment plans before the end of the payment freeze.Advertisement\n\nIncome-driven repayment plans allow you to set an affordable payment amount based on income and family size.You can find more information about the four types of income-driven repayment plans here.___You can find all of AP\u2019s financial wellness coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/financial-wellness.___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps.Authorities said at least 1,300 people and some 250 pets remain in shelters across the island.Fiona sparked a blackout when it hit Puerto Rico\u2019s southwest corner on Sunday, the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.By Tuesday morning, authorities said they had restored power to more than 260,000 customers on the island of 3.2 million people.Advertisement\n\nPuerto Rico Gov.

It\u2019s been happening in plain sight.In June, the AFA sent an email to supporters urging them to prepare for \u201cbattle\u201d at the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers expedited efforts to pass bipartisan gun safety legislation. Dorr\u2019s warnings in that email echo the statements made by Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, when he whipped up his supporters at a rally to storm the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as president. That led to a violent insurrection.\u201cThey\u2019re coming after us right now,\u201d Dorr wrote in the June email. \u201cOur federal legislative team believes that because of the enormity of the battle this week in DC, there will be thousands or even tens of thousands of Bloomberg-funded, red shirt radical, commie mommies all over the Capitol complex.\u201d\u201cThis is their Super Bowl,\u201d he added. \u201cYou and I should be looking at this battle in exactly the same way.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nLike Trump, Dorr also didn\u2019t waste an opportunity to use overheated rhetoric and attacks on federal law enforcement to ask for money.\u201cWe must stand up against this madman and the entire Radical Left before it\u2019s too late!

Maria was the deadliest storm to sweep across the island, causing more than 3,000 deaths, leaving lasting damage and creating fierce tension between the territory and former President Donald Trump.Advertisement\n\nOfficials planned to modernize the Puerto Rican electric grid after Maria using federal funds, but the effort has been slow and power is still largely supplied via a patchwork system of old equipment. Billions of dollars in relief funding for recovery after that hurricane hasn\u2019t been spent, and what has been allocated has largely gone to cleanup efforts rather than permanent works that could improve roads or utilities, The New York Times reported.Fiona was classified as a Category 1 hurricane but still caused widespread damage, underscoring the island\u2019s vulnerability to fierce storms that experts say will only become more frequent due to climate change.Residents affected by Hurricane Fiona rest Monday at a Salinas school being used as a storm shelter.Alejandro Granadillo/Associated PressSome areas were hit with nearly 30 inches of rain, prompting severe flooding.Alejandro Granadillo/Associated PressEmployees remove mud from a hardware store in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Salinas, Puerto Rico, on Monday.Ricardo Arduengo/ReutersAdvertisement\n\nA road is blocked by a mudslide caused by Hurricane Fiona in Cayey, Puerto Rico, on Sunday.Stephanie Rojas/Associated PressPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration on Monday, ordering that federal resources be marshaled to help the island recover.

Glenn Youngkin is now endorsing a woman who insists the 2020 election was stolen from the former president and who has compared herself and other Trump supporters to Jesus.Youngkin is to spend a day next month campaigning with Kari Lake, the GOP nominee for governor in Arizona and one of the most prolific spreaders of Trump\u2019s election lies in the Republican world outside of Trump himself.Advertisement\n\nRepublicans who left the party because of Trump\u2019s misdeeds, culminating in his coup attempt on Jan. 6, 2021, said Youngkin\u2019s willingness to support election liars like Lake is revealing.\u201cHe didn\u2019t run as a \u2018normal\u2019 Republican. He ran as an enabler of the crazies. In today\u2019s GOP, there are crazies and there are enablers of the crazies,\u201d said Joe Walsh, a former GOP congressman from Illinois. \u201cHis helping Kari Lake, a crazy, get elected, is not a surprise and reinforces his status as an enabler.\u201dDavid Jolly, a former GOP congressman from Florida, said Youngkin \u2015 who\u2019s unable to run for reelection because of Virginia\u2019s single-term limit \u2015 is now trying to appeal to the median Republican voter nationally, which means countenancing Trump\u2019s stolen election claims.\u201cI feel a little duped myself in how I saw his candidacy,\u201d Jolly said. \u201cIt may be we put too much stock in Youngkin the candidate instead of realizing his race was likely just an exercise in matching a message with where the constituency was for the Virginia general election.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nYoungkin\u2019s political operation declined to comment on his decision to support Lake, or on the former television newscaster\u2019s various statements during her campaign.Last week, when Youngkin visited Reno, Nevada, in support of the GOP nominee for governor there, HuffPost asked him how he\u2019d respond to fellow Republicans, like Lake, who continue to insist the 2020 election was stolen.\u201cWe have to look forward. That\u2019s what we have to do as Republicans,\u201d Youngkin said, using the euphemism some Republicans have adopted to suggest the party should stop dwelling on Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cThe reality of course is that we have to work to make people feel more confident about the election process.\u201dLake, though, is not likely to stop repeating Trump\u2019s lie that the election was rigged and stolen when it comes time for Youngkin\u2019s Oct. 19 visit.\u201cThe Kari Lake you had in the primary is the Kari Lake you get in the general,\u201d one Lake aide said on condition of anonymity, adding that Youngkin\u2019s staff had not made any requests that Lake not repeat the stolen election lie during their day together.Advertisement\n\nLake won Trump\u2019s support early on with her visits to his Mar-a-Lago social club in Florida and her enthusiastic embrace of his repeatedly debunked claims of massive fraud in the 2020 election. More recently, during a campaign visit at a church, she repeated his 2015 claim that immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border are criminals.\u201cThey are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They are rapists, and that\u2019s who\u2019s coming across our border,\u201d she said.In that same appearance, she said she didn\u2019t mind if President Joe Biden criticized her and Trump followers who support the mob that assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6 because Jesus Christ was also criticized.\u201cYou can call us extremists. You can call us domestic terrorists. You know who else was called a lot of names his whole life? Jesus,\u201d she said.Youngkin, who took office in January, narrowly defeated Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in a race that turned on Youngkin\u2019s ability to spur high turnout among Trump supporters in rural Virginia counties while trimming his losses in the state\u2019s northern suburbs, where Trump is largely loathed.Advertisement\n\nHe did so by emphasizing education, crime and inflation while largely ignoring Trump\u2019s election lies. His ability to win a state that Biden carried by double digits in 2020 immediately made him a potential contender in the eyes of major GOP donors.Youngkin\u2019s failure now to chart a course away from Trumpism is disappointing, one senior Republican strategist said.\u201cIt\u2019s expected that Donald Trump and [Florida Gov.] Ron DeSantis would campaign for Kari Lake. It\u2019s very frustrating to see Glenn Youngkin cast his lot with them as opposed to standing with the sane and rational Republicans who recognize that our party will never move forward if we embrace election deniers and condone their dangerous lies,\u201d the consultant said on condition of anonymity. \u201cWhile he may see political upside to appealing to the QAnon crowd as he grows his national brand, he\u2019s doing permanent damage to any chance of being seen as a responsible leader with respected principles.\u201dTo Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, Youngkin\u2019s decision to campaign with Kari Lake, rather than denouncing her, is beyond disappointing and more an abdication.\u201cYoungkin has already campaigned for a rogue\u2019s gallery of election deniers \u2015 I prefer the term \u2018election liars.\u2019 Tudor Dixon in Michigan, Paul LePage in Maine, Joe Lombardo in Nevada, and others,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cSo Kari Lake fits right in, but she may be the most extreme of the lot.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nRelated...Glenn Youngkin Brings His 'I'm Not Thinking About 2024 Yet' Tour To Early Voting NevadaVirginia Gov.

The DOJ is investigating if the former president or his aides engaged in any impropriety or intentionally withheld documents from government investigators.Trump, who has blasted the search as a political attack, filed suit to have a court appoint an outside arbiter known as a special master to vet the material for any documents protected by attorney-client or executive privilege \u2015 even though he is no longer a member of the executive branch.In a ruling earlier this month that shocked legal experts, a federal judge he appointed in 2020 approved that request and paused the DOJ\u2019s investigation into the documents.The DOJ appealed that decision, but has since said it would not block the appointment of the special master. Rather, the agency asked an appeals court last week to give the FBI access to some 100 of the most sensitive documents taken from Mar-a-Lago rather than see them go through the vetting process.

(Coffee County, Georgia via AP)Coffee County, Georgia via APAdvertisement\n\nAttorney Sidney Powell and other Trump allies were involved in arranging for the copying of the election equipment in Coffee County \u2014 which is home to 43,000 people and voted overwhelmingly for Trump \u2014 as part of a wider effort to access voting equipment in several states, according to documents produced in response to subpoenas in the long-running lawsuit over Georgia\u2019s voting machines.Latham\u2019s \u201cdata likely will reveal additional details about the work performed and information obtained in the breach, what was done with the compromised software and data, and the people involved in planning and orchestrating the breach, which puts voters and future elections at enormous risk,\u201d the filing says.An exhibit attached to the Monday filing juxtaposes quotes from Latham\u2019s deposition with images pulled from security camera footage that appear to directly contradict her statements.Latham said that she went to her job as a high school teacher and stopped by the election office briefly that afternoon. But the video image shows her arriving at 11:37 a.m., and time stamps on other images show her there throughout much of the day. She also said she didn\u2019t see specific people and saw others only briefly, but the video images show otherwise.The lawsuit that includes the fight over Latham\u2019s personal electronic devices was originally filed several years before the 2020 election by individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, an election security advocacy group. It alleges that Georgia\u2019s touchscreen voting machines are not secure and seeks to have them replaced by hand-marked paper ballots.Advertisement\n\nThe Monday filing said the plaintiffs have identified multiple documents that Latham failed to produce in response to a previous subpoena. It seeks to have a third party make a temporary forensic copy of her devices and search for responsive documents.Related...GOP Candidate Robert Burns Proposed Abortion Panels In 2018Jeffrey Clark Investigated By DOJ On Jan. 6-Related Charges, D.C.

AP Photo/Seth WenigThe 77th General Assembly meeting of world leaders convenes under the shadow of Europe\u2019s first major war since World War II \u2014 the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has unleashed a global food crisis and opened fissures among major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War.Advertisement\n\nYet nearly 150 heads of state and government are on the latest speakers\u2019 list. That\u2019s a sign that despite the fragmented state of the planet, the United Nations remains the key gathering place for presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers to not only deliver their views but to meet privately to discuss the challenges on the global agenda \u2015 and hopefully make some progress.At the top of that agenda for many: Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which not only threatens the sovereignty of its smaller neighbor but has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe at Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant in the country\u2019s now Russia-occupied southeast.Leaders in many countries are trying to prevent a wider war and restore peace in Europe. Diplomats, though, aren\u2019t expecting any breakthroughs this week.The loss of important grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia has triggered a food crisis, especially in developing countries, and inflation and a rising cost of living in many others. Those issues are high on the agenda.At a meeting Monday to promote U.N. goals for 2030 \u2014 including ending extreme poverty, ensuring quality education for all children and achieving gender equality \u2014 Guterres said the world\u2019s many pressing perils make it \u201ctempting to put our long-term development priorities to one side.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nBut the U.N. chief said some things can\u2019t wait \u2014 among them education, dignified jobs, full equality for women and girls, comprehensive health care and action to tackle the climate crisis. He called for public and private finance and investment, and above all for peace.The death of Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II and her funeral in London on Monday, which many world leaders attended, have created last-minute headaches for the high-level meeting. Diplomats and U.N. staff have scrambled to deal with changes in travel plans, the timing of events and the logistically intricate speaking schedule for world leaders.The global gathering, known as the General Debate, was entirely virtual in 2020 because of the pandemic, and hybrid in 2021. This year, the 193-member General Assembly returns to only in-person speeches, with a single exception \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Over objections from Russia and a few allies, the assembly voted last Friday to allow the Ukrainian leader to prerecord his speech because of reasons beyond his control \u2014 the \u201congoing foreign invasion\u201d and military hostilities that require him to carry out his \u201cnational defense and security duties.\u201dBy tradition, Brazil has spoken first for over seven decades because, at the early General Assembly sessions, it volunteered to start when no other country did.Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. president, representing the host country for the United Nations, is traditionally the second speaker. But Joe Biden is attending the queen\u2019s funeral, and his speech has been pushed to Wednesday morning. Senegalese President Macky Sall is expected to take Biden\u2019s slot.___Edith M.

Public anger has grown since authorities on Friday announced the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in a hospital after three days in a coma, following her arrest by Tehran's morality police during a visit to the capital on September 13. (Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images)- via Getty ImagesThe U.N. body said Iran\u2019s morality police have expanded their patrols in recent months, targeting women for not properly wearing the Islamic headscarf, known as hijab. It said verified videos show women being slapped in the face, struck with batons and thrown into police vans for wearing the hijab too loosely.A similar patrol detained 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last Tuesday, taking her to a police station where she collapsed. She died three days later. Iranian police have denied mistreating Amini and say she died of a heart attack.

Protests erupted there after her funeral and police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators on Saturday and Sunday. Several protesters were arrested.The governor of Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province, Esmail Zarei Kousha, told Fars that three people were killed by unnamed armed groups, linking the violence to the unrest.Advertisement\n\nHe did not identify the victims, but said one was killed in the town of Divandarreh by a weapon not used by Iranian security forces.

A news website affiliated with state TV said 22 people were arrested at a protest in the northern city of Rasht.State TV showed footage of protests on Monday, including images of two police cars with their windows smashed. It said the protesters torched two motorbikes as well, and that they burned Iranian flags in Kurdish areas and Tehran.The state-run broadcaster blamed the unrest on foreign countries and exiled opposition groups, accusing them of using Amini\u2019s death as a pretext for more economic sanctions.Iran has seen waves of protests in recent years, mainly over a long-running economic crisis exacerbated by Western sanctions linked to the country\u2019s nuclear program.

His only comment at the time was a cryptic tweet of a 2020 speech by Portuguese soccer manager Jose Mourinho: \u201cI prefer not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble ... and I don\u2019t want to be in big trouble.\u201dCarlsen\u2019s actions on Monday were called out by other chess players, including grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer, his fellow countryman, who called for sanctions against Carlsen, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the most unacceptable behavior to lose on purpose. The most unsportsmanlike [thing] you can do,\u201d according to Defector.com.Neither Carlsen nor Niemann has commented on Monday\u2019s game, but Kotaku.com noted that Carlsen\u2019s actions were especially shocking since his own organization is hosting the tournament, which means he \u201ceffectively invited his apparent nemesis to his virtual home and then walked out the back.\u201d Related...Chess Player Insists He Didn't Use Sex Toy To Defeat World ChampionChess Robot Breaks 7-Year-Old Opponent's Finger", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/magnus-carlsen-chess-resigns-hans-niemann_n_6328dcbfe4b07198f011a888", "title": "World Champion Chess Player Resigns Game Rather Than Play Teen Who Beat Him Earlier"}, {"authors": "Cole Delbyck", "date_publish": "2022-09-20T11:29:22-0400", "description": "Adam Levine arrives at the Baby2Baby Gala", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Adam Levine arrives at the Baby2Baby Gala. via Associated PressAdam Levine is admitting to \u201cpoor judgment\u201d but not a full-fledged affair after an Instagram influencer claimed she carried on an extramarital relationship with the Maroon 5 frontman for months.

Mark Warner (D-Va.) has told the story of a constituent, a single mom named Sara, whose estranged ex-husband refused to pay off his part of their consolidated loan. Advertisement\n\n\u201cSara faced the threat of having her wages as a public school teacher garnished if she did not pay both her and her ex-husband\u2019s portions of their debt,\u201d Warner\u2019s office said in a statement when the Senate passed the bill. Advocates for survivors of domestic violence, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, endorsed the legislation. The bill represents a modest tweak to student loan policy after Biden said he would unilaterally wipe out student debt on a huge scale. Once the new forgiveness policy takes effect, the White House has said that as many as 43 million people could benefit, with borrowers who received Pell Grants qualifying for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation. There are only around 14,000 outstanding consolidated spousal loans, by contrast. Though the bill had bipartisan backing in the Senate, where it passed without even a roll call vote, House Republicans on the Rules Committee said it needed to be changed before going to the White House for Biden\u2019s signature.Specifically, they said the bill would take too long for the Department of Education to implement, would expand the role of government in student loans and could be exploited by abusers.Advertisement\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House Education and Labor Committee, said as currently written, the bill would allow either party in a joint consolidated loan to file for a new loan, potentially leaving their spouse with little control over how much each would owe on the original loan balance.\u201cIn some cases, this could leave the abused spouse with an economic burden that doesn\u2019t belong to that person,\u201d she said.Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said the formula in the bill would make it simple to figure out what share of debt goes to whom.\u201cIf we amend it, and possibly even make it worse, it goes over to the Senate and who knows what happens, if the clock ever starts or if we see the bill again,\u201d he said.McGovern said if not for House GOP objections, the bill could have been quickly passed as part of a group of routine, non-controversial bills the House votes on each week, skipping the Rules Committee.Advertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating that we\u2019re here,\u201d he said.Related...A Massive Rail Strike Looms As Unions Fight For Sick Leave\u2018It\u2019s Just Cruel\u2019: White House Blasts GOP For Sending Migrants To Democratic CitiesBill To Help Afghans Who Escaped Taliban Faces Long Odds In The Senate", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/student-loans-spouses-abuse_n_6329ce6be4b0ed991abd5c2e", "title": "House Set To Pass Bill Helping Domestic Violence Survivors Escape Abusers' Debts"}, {"authors": "Cole Delbyck", "date_publish": "2022-09-20T13:59:40-0400", "description": "Amy Schumer attends the premiere of Season 2 for \"Only Murders in the Building", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Amy Schumer attends the premiere of Season 2 for \"Only Murders in the Building.\"Frazer Harrison via Getty ImagesIn a bid to get herself \u201cforever cancelled,\u201d Amy Schumer is reviving her long-thought-dormant show \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d for another season.

The concerted and quickening Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war following Ukrainian successes on the battlefield.The scheduling of referendums starting Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions came after a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said the votes are needed and as Moscow is losing ground in the invasion it began nearly seven months ago, increasing pressure on the Kremlin for a stiff response.Advertisement\n\nFormer President Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council chaired by Putin, said referendums that fold regions into Russia itself would make redrawn frontiers \u201cirreversible\u201d and enable Moscow to use \u201cany means\u201d to defend them.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba denounced the votes as a sham and tweeted that \u201cUkraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.\u201dThe votes, in territory Russia already controls, are all but certain to go Moscow\u2019s way but are unlikely to be recognized by Western governments who are backing Ukraine with military and other support that has helped its forces seize momentum on battlefields in the east and south.Russian President Putin delivers a speech during a meeting on the military-industrial complex at the Kremlin on Sept. 20, 2022 in Moscow, Russia.

Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders\u2019 hands against failing morale reported among soldiers.Ukrainian soldiers ride in an armored tank in the town of Izium, recently liberated by Ukrainian Armed Forces, in the Kharkiv region.

More aid also is expected from Britain, already one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers after the U.S. British Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to promise that in 2023, her government will \u201cmatch or exceed\u201d the 2.3 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in military aid given to Ukraine this year.Advertisement\n\nThe swiftness of the Ukrainian counteroffensive also saw Russian forces abandon armored vehicles and other weapons as they beat hasty retreats. Ukrainian forces are recycling the captured weaponry back into battle. A Washington-based think tank, The Institute for the Study of War, said abandoned Russian T-72 tanks are being used by Ukrainian forces seeking to push into Russian-occupied Luhansk.In the counteroffensive\u2019s wake, Ukrainian officials found hundreds of graves near the once-occupied city of Izium. Yevhenii Yenin, a deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s Internal Affairs Ministry, told a national telecast that officials found many bodies \u201cwith signs of violent death.\u201d\u201cThese are broken ribs and broken heads, men with bound hands, broken jaws and severed genitalia,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s southern military command said its troops sank a Russian barge carrying troops and weapons across the Dnieper River near the Russian-occupied city of Nova Kakhovka.

Sumner Stroh, who has just under 350,000 Instagram followers, made the allegations in a TikTok video posted Monday. She claims she saw the married singer for about a year but did not clarify when. Levine\u2019s wife is Victoria\u2019s Secret model Behati Prinsloo. Advertisement\n\n\u201cI was having an affair with a man who\u2019s married to a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. At the time, I was young, I was naive, and, I mean, quite frankly, I feel exploited,\u201d Stroh said in the video.Levine has been married to Prinsloo since 2014. The couple announced this month that they are expecting their third child. They have two daughters, who are 4 and 5.In her TikTok video, Stroh shared a screenshot of an Instagram DM that Levine had allegedly sent her \u201cafter I stopped talking to him over a period of months.\u201d The message reads: \u201cOk serious question. I\u2019m having another baby and if it\u2019s [a] boy I really wanna name it Sumner. You ok with that?

It\u2019s Behati and her children, and for that, I\u2019m so so sorry.\u201dStroh also clarified what she meant when she claimed she was manipulated.\u201cThe most important part that I did definitely gloss over is the fact that I was under the impression that their marriage was over. I believed that they were keeping it quiet to avoid the negative press because, as I had said, I was new to LA, so I just assumed that with celebrities of that caliber, that that\u2019s just how it was,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I feel exploited, because he knew I believed everything that he said because of my vulnerable position of being new to LA,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, he was DMing me straight from his verified Instagram account. I didn\u2019t have any reason to further question it.

They had him evaluated, and he was diagnosed with autism.The diagnosis, Martinez told HuffPost, \u201chas impacted every aspect of his life, and our life as a family, as my son is now 14 years old, nonverbal and still has difficulty understanding the world around him.\u201d Advertisement\n\nThe diagnosis also affected Martinez\u2019s mental health.\u201cWhen my son was first diagnosed, I felt overwhelmed and isolated. I would often get lost in caring for his needs without realizing the toll his constant care was having on my own mental health, until I fell into a deep depression,\u201d Martinez said.She neglected her own need for care until her husband and grandmother eventually brought her to the hospital for help. Since then, Martinez has relied on a psychiatrist, antidepressants and support from the organization Autism Speaks, in addition to the support of her husband and grandmother.Martinez\u2019s experience is not uncommon among parents of children with autism or other health conditions. A recent study from the University of California, San Francisco found that 50% of mothers of children with autism had clinically significant symptoms of depression, compared to 6%-14% of mothers of children without autism.Advertisement\n\nImportantly, the study also found that a \u201cmother\u2019s higher symptoms of depression did not predict an increase in children\u2019s behavior problems over time,\u201d said Danielle Roubinov, the study\u2019s lead author. Roubinov told HuffPost that this finding should help alleviate feelings of guilt a parent might have about their own mental health struggles affecting their child. \u201cWhen there is a child with special needs, understandably a lot of resources are directed to the child,\u201d Roubinov said. \u201cEqually as important is the support for caregiving parents.\u201dBut parents who are fully absorbed in caring for a child may not feel able to ask for help. If they believe their child\u2019s needs must come first, then the parent\u2019s needs never get addressed.Caregiving is an isolating experience for parentsTaylor T., who asked that HuffPost withhold her last name for privacy reasons, has a daughter who was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 20 months old and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. (The treatment is 29 months long, and \u201cshe has a great prognosis,\u201d Taylor said).\u201cSo many people say, \u2018What are you doing for yourself?\u2019 which is a nice sentiment, but it just further divides me and those people,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t understand is that I don\u2019t have the time, the energy, or the mental capacity to do anything for myself. I am with my daughter quite literally keeping her alive 24/7.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nWhile she experienced anxiety before her child\u2019s illness, her feelings of terror were both amplified and silenced by her daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis.\u201cI have had multiple panic attacks while alone with her in the ER in the middle of the night or if something wasn\u2019t going as planned during a chemo infusion. The hardest part is hiding those attacks, sitting down and handing her an iPad for 15 minutes, and trying to recompose myself,\u201d she said.Taylor and other parents like her say that receiving a serious diagnosis divides their lives into a \u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter.\u201d\u201cI used to be outgoing and make friends easily,\u201d said Taylor, explaining that she now walks around \u201cfeeling like no one understands me or what we\u2019ve been through.\u201dExcept for the people who do: other parents facing the same diagnosis.\u201cSupport from other moms going through the same or very similar situations has been better than any therapy I could find,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI met a friend very early on who has a daughter who was just a few months ahead of us in treatment. We instantly connected and she became a constant source of understanding, I truly do not think I could have gotten through as well as I did without her.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her friend, Taylor regularly meets with a group of other \u201ccancer moms\u201d via video call.\u201cTo have a group of women who really understand our day to day, and not only the medical aspects, but the emotional aspects, is priceless,\u201d she said.Some parents in this position find support on social mediaFor Laurie Foos, the mother of a 15-year-old son who has autism, anxiety and developmental disabilities, social media has provided a source of support.\u201cI have spent countless hours following the threads of Facebook parent support groups that were often a lifeline, in order not only to understand why a particular behavior had cropped up, but about the workings of a school district and what services were available to him and why,\u201d she told HuffPost.Foos said that social media, \u201cfor all of its issues, often provides a safe space for parents like myself who might not know where to turn for answers. Many of those people, whom I have never actually met in real life, have given me strength and courage and made me feel less alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s often hard for me to ask for help,\u201d continued Foos, \u201cbut I do my best also to stay connected with other parents of children with developmental disabilities, as there is an understanding there that transcends words.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nBrittany Magnus, whose 3-year-old son has the same cancer diagnosis as Taylor\u2019s daughter, and who also has a 7-year-old son with Crohn\u2019s disease, told HuffPost that she sees a therapist and takes medication for anxiety \u201cto get through the days,\u201d as well as receiving essential support from fellow \u201ccancer moms.\u201dA social media group organized by another mom has proven invaluable to Magnus.\u201cIt makes you feel not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were all feeling the same emotions \u2014 the fear, the PTSD. Sometimes I would feel like I\u2019m going crazy, but then they\u2019re feeling it, too.\u201dSasi Ponchaisang / EyeEm via Getty ImagesCaregiving parents may feel guilty for having their own struggles. Parents also can experience PTSD following their child\u2019s diagnosisPost-traumatic stress disorder is not uncommon among the parents of children with serious medical conditions. A recent study found that when children with heart rhythm problems were given implanted cardioverter-defibrillators, afterward, nearly half of their parents met the screening criteria for PTSD. By comparison, 12% of the children who underwent the surgical procedure met those same criteria.Lauren Schneider, a psychologist at Stanford and lead author of the study, told HuffPost that the parents who met the cutoff for PTSD \u201care likely experiencing distressing traumatic stress symptoms.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nSchneider said the study identifies \u201ca need for increased mental health screening for pediatric patients and their parents within medical clinics.\u201d She hopes that the results of the study encourage parents to seek treatment if they are struggling.While neither of Magnus\u2019 sons has had heart surgery, she said that the study\u2019s findings hold true in her experience, acknowledging trauma that parents endure alongside \u2014 and perhaps on behalf of \u2014 their children.\u201cThat\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re there to support our kid, to make it not scary,\u201d Magnus said.Taylor also spoke of hoping to shield her daughter from the trauma of her diagnosis by taking it on herself.\u201cMy greatest hope is that the PTSD that has and will go along with this experience is mine and my husband\u2019s to hold,\u201d she said.While heart conditions, cancer and autism are vastly different diagnoses, several themes recur as these parents tell their stories: the isolation they feel, the struggle to attend to their own emotional needs when the needs of their child are so great, and the comfort they can find only in the company of others who understand what they\u2019re experiencing.Advertisement\n\nWhere to get supportIf you are the caregiver of a child with a serious diagnosis, there are likely organizations specific to your child\u2019s condition that can connect you with support groups and other services. Examples include Autism Speaks, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, United Cerebral Palsy and Parent to Parent.If you\u2019d like to connect with others locally, ask the person who coordinates your care at the hospital or doctor\u2019s office if they can put you in touch with other families. A family life specialist or social worker may be able to offer referrals as well.You can also start your own support group, either in person or virtually. The group Magnus is a part of uses the Marco Polo app so that members can video chat with one another.Individual therapy may also be helpful. The American Psychological Association has a locator tool that lists psychologists in your area or who offer telehealth, and who take your insurance. Many therapists are now practicing online, and companies like Talkspace can help you find a provider, as well. Other affordable resources include training clinics, providers with sliding-scale fees and community-based organizations.\u201cParents sometimes feel guilty for struggling,\u201d said Schneider, who hopes that the PTSD study \u201cnormalizes the difficulties some parents experience, alleviates their guilt and ultimately encourages them to consider an evaluation and possibly treatment, or at least helps them to initiate a discussion with a provider.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nTelling a friend or family member that you need help can also be a good start \u2014 even if they don\u2019t totally understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed or afraid to say that you are mentally and emotionally exhausted,\u201d Martinez said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Brittany Magnus\u2019 last name.

Think of it like your brain\u2019s get-up-and-go. You have to turn the key, put the car in drive, then press on the gas \u2014 otherwise, you won\u2019t actually go anywhere. Advertisement\n\nYour mind works the same way. Long to-do lists, big projects or annoying household chores can sometimes feel so overwhelming that starting your metaphorical ignition may seem impossible. But if you can\u2019t get started, then you\u2019ll be stuck with wheels spinning, frustrated that you\u2019ve missed deadlines, were late again, or ignored assignments, texts, emails, dirty dishes \u2015 or anything else you wanted to do but just couldn\u2019t. Anyone can struggle with task initiation, but it is especially prevalent in those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is associated with executive dysfunction. Chanel Johnson, a licensed professional counselor and CEO of Altus Home Counseling and Behavioral Services LLC in Detroit, has worked with several adults with ADHD or who need help with task initiation. In fact, even she needs help with this sometimes. \u201cI\u2019ve found myself struggling with task initiation as well, including waiting until the last minute, missing deadlines, or neglecting things completely,\u201d Johnson told HuffPost. \u201cThis can be extremely frustrating, especially if you are a perfectionist or the person other people look to to have it all together.\u201d There can be many reasons you struggle to get started on something, including fatigue, anxiety, perfectionism, procrastination, executive dysfunction and lack of motivation, according to Johnson.Advertisement\n\nBilly Roberts, a therapist at Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio, said underlying anxieties are a big contributor to task initiation challenges. This includes fear of failure or perfectionism. \u201cSince their expectations of themselves are so high, they feel frozen when it\u2019s time to get started,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother possibility is a general sense of overwhelm. Having so many tasks or steps, it\u2019s hard to know where to start.\u201dIt can be so frustrating when you want to do something but can\u2019t make yourself start. Luckily there are tools to help. Keep reading for these expert-backed things to try if you struggle with task initiation. Practice chunking\u201cA great way to get started is a skill called \u2018chunking,\u2019 which means breaking things down into small actionable steps,\u201d Roberts said. He also suggests people should \u201clower their expectations if they find a task too daunting and recognize that done is better than perfect.\u201dKate McCann, a licensed mental health counselor who has a private counseling practice based in Worcester, Massachusetts, gives an example of how to break down an overwhelming task. Advertisement\n\n\u201cRather than think, \u2018I have to clean the whole kitchen, and it\u2019s a mess, I don\u2019t know where to start, and it will take forever,\u2019 break it down into, \u2018to clean the kitchen, I have to first put away any food that\u2019s been left out. Then get the dish rack emptied. Then I have to empty the dishwasher. Then I can get the dirty dishes loaded. Then I can wash the pots. Then I can wipe down the counters. Then I can watch the Real Housewives as a treat because I will be done,\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cBreaking the task down into small do-able parts that get paced out can help break down that wall of total resistance,\u201d McCann added.Transition to the task by doing another activity first Kara Nassour, a therapist at Shaded Bough Counseling in Austin, Texas, suggests using another activity to help you transition to the task you want to do. \u201cIf it\u2019s hard to get off the couch to mow the lawn, it may be easier to get up, walk around the yard while listening to music, and then mow the lawn,\u201d Nassour said. \u201cIf you\u2019re struggle to start your homework, looking over your previous homework might help get your brain on track.\u201dLaylaBird via Getty ImagesLimiting your to-do list will help your tasks feel less overwhelming.Advertisement\n\nNarrow your list down to just three itemsSometimes huge to-do lists can be overwhelming \u2014 not to mention impossible to get done in one day. Katie Ziskind, a therapist and owner of Wisdom Within Counseling, suggests picking three main goals. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any clean laundry and you need clean clothes for work in the morning, but you still have some fruits, beans, rice, and pasta to eat, doing laundry will be more important than going food shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you think you\u2019d find food shopping more fun than laundry.\u201dZiskind added that \u201cwhen you don\u2019t feel motivated, that can come from feeling like you have too much responsibility.\u201dRedefine successTelling yourself you have to finish everything to feel accomplished is setting yourself up for failure. Instead, Johnson recommends rethinking what you consider a win. \u201cRedefine success of a task to make it more manageable or easier,\u201d she said. \u201cAn example is to tell yourself that washing half of the dishes today will count as a win instead of saying you have to do them all and clean the whole kitchen to feel accomplished.\u201d Sometimes, just doing a few dishes is all you can do that day, and that\u2019s OK.Advertisement\n\nFigure out exactly how much time it takes to do the taskSometimes it\u2019s hard to get started on something when we think it\u2019ll take longer or shorter than it really will. \u201cSay your goal is to unload the dishwasher,\u201d said Mary Hadley, a speech language pathologist who specializes in executive functioning challenges at Signpost Speech and Language Therapy in Austin, Texas. \u201cWrite down how long you think it will take, time yourself and see how long it really took.\u201dThis isn\u2019t so you can judge yourself on how long it took; rather, it\u2019s a way to build awareness and get a better understanding of yourself. This can make it easier to plan your day and say no to things you really don\u2019t have time for. Once your day feels more manageable, it can be easier to get started.\u201cBeing unrealistic about what you can get done in a day often makes initiating tasks harder,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou set yourself up for failure.\u201dAllow yourself a set time to be distracted Distractions are going to happen, so embrace them. \u201cAllow yourself to be distracted, but set a timer for your distractions,\u201d Johnson recommended.Advertisement\n\nZiskind suggested an alarm to stop yourself from scrolling Instagram or TikTok, \u201cwhich can eat into the time you would have to complete tasks and do chores.\u201d Outsource help There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for or seeking help. If there\u2019s a task you find you consistently aren\u2019t able to motivate yourself to do (like cleaning the bathrooms), then hire someone else to do it, if you can. Or offer a trade with a partner or friend. Ziskind said even doing this one time can help you.Speak kindly to yourself Cheer yourself on like you would a friend. \u201cSpeaking kindly to yourself, being your own cheerleader, and encouraging yourself are keys to starting tasks and getting tasks done,\u201d Ziskind said.Hadley agreed, encouraging people to regularly engage in \u201cpositive self-talk.\u201d \u201cThis is a simple, free, and surprisingly powerful tool to implement into your daily life,\u201d she said.\u201cTalk to your anxiety or distractibility as you are getting started on a task: \u2018Hey anxiety, good to see you, thanks for stopping by but I don\u2019t need you right now,\u2019\u201d Hadley explained. \u201cOr, \u2018I\u2019m going to set a time and work on this for 20 minutes. I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 Remind yourself this is a process; it will take a while to feel accomplished and there is no such thing as perfection.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nRyanJLane via Getty ImagesGiving yourself small treats after accomplishing your tasks can help motivate you to complete them.Reward yourselfDitch the old advice of doing the hardest thing on your list first. Instead, start and end with something fun. \u201cDo something that you want to do first and plan something that you are looking forward to do afterward as a reward,\u201d Johnson said.Focus on the end resultMake a vision board, write down your goals, or just picture what you want your end result to look like to keep you motivated.\u201cHave visual reminders of the overall goal,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor example, if you have issues getting started on work projects, but you\u2019re looking forward to moving up in the company, have a sheet of paper you can look at with your name and the title that you want behind it.\u201d Advertisement\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, think about how happy you\u2019ll feel in the short term. \u201cImagine how grateful your future self will be to your present self for getting it done,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI do chores on Thursday mornings so Weekend [Me] doesn\u2019t have to do them, and Weekend [Me] LOVES Thursday [Me] for that.\u201dShe explained that avoidance offers a momentary relief, but ultimately makes you feel worse at the end of the day. \u201cNo one wants to do the task now or feels like doing a chore but consider how you would like to feel afterward,\u201d McCann continued, adding, \u201cIf you complete some small steps, and give yourself lots of praise for doing so, you will feel good about yourself at the end of the day.\u201dPay attention to how you feelNassour suggested paying attention to how you feel when you find yourself avoiding tasks. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling tired, depressed, anxious, irritable, or in pain, that\u2019s likely interfering with the task you meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAddress the underlying problem and you will probably get more done.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t criticize yourself for struggling to start tasks, because feelings of guilt and shame can make your brain associate that feeling with the task, and subconsciously make you want to avoid it in the future,\u201d she added, suggesting treating the underlying anxieties or other issues.Take care of your healthMaking your health a priority can help make task initiation easier. \u201cTake care of your mind and body,\u201d Nassour said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not getting enough food or sleep, or come home exhausted, or are in pain all the time, these things will interfere with getting things done.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nShe added that a regular use of cannabis, alcohol or other substances could affect you as well, and limiting them \u201cmay improve your motivation in other areas of life.\u201dReach out to a therapist for helpTherapy can help those struggling with task initiation. A cognitive behavioral therapy approach that reframes \u201cnegative cognitions and beliefs into positive ones helps you see a problem as less daunting and yourself as more competent, which helps you engage in different behaviors,\u201d according to McCann.Psychodynamic therapy, otherwise known as \u201cwhy do I feel the way I feel\u201d therapy, may help as well. Roberts explained it \u201ccan help with resolving any underlying emotional issues related to task initiation.\u201d  Discovering tricks to jump-start your brain and improve task initiation can be a game changer. We all have bad days or times we struggle with procrastination, but with some health maintenance, self-kindness and plenty of rewards, it can start to get easier.Related...12 Mindless Habits That Are Secretly Exhausting You7 Mistakes You're Making In The Morning That Ruin Your ProductivityThe Difference Between Stress And Burnout (And How To Tell Which You Have)", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/procrastination-task-initiation-tips_l_632878eee4b0eac9f4e404d0", "title": "If You Struggle To Start Or Complete Tasks, These 13 Tips Are For You"}, {"authors": "Caroline Bologna", "date_publish": "2022-09-20T05:45:01-0400", "description": "Linda, Donna, Richard, Larry", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Linda, Donna, Richard, Larry.

You\u2019ve surely heard the expression about one bad apple spoiling the whole bunch. While it\u2019s a metaphor for someone whose behavior makes a whole group look bad, it might also literally refer to the actual fruits and vegetables in your fridge. When you find one rotten grape in a pack or moldy bell pepper in your crisper drawer, is the produce touching these items still safe to eat? Or should you throw everything away? \u201cWhile one rotten apple can spoil the bunch, it takes time to do so,\u201d said Matt Regusci, director of growth and public relations at ASI, a company that provides food safety inspections, certifications and consulting. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to dump the whole vegetable drawer because of one rotten piece of fruit or veggie\u2014just throw out the produce touching the rotten item.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also likely safe to eat produce that has touched a moldy item, as long as you wash it first and eat it quickly, he added. But there are many factors to consider. Here\u2019s what you should know about how spoiled produce can affect nearby items and how to decide whether it\u2019s still OK to eat. Can rotten or moldy produce contaminate other items? There are hundreds of thousands of species of molds, which are microscopic fungi that live on plant and animal matter, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mold commonly spreads by releasing spores into the air, said Vanessa Coffman, director of the Alliance to Stop Foodborne Illness. It can also spread via water or insects. So, mold can easily migrate from one piece of fruit or vegetable to another that\u2019s touching it, said Tamika Sims, senior director of food technology communications at the International Food Information Council. \u201cIt\u2019s best to first throw away the moldy produce and inspect the produce touching it for mold,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you see mold, feel mushy skin or see discoloration, this produce must also be discarded.\u201d Advertisement\n\nAnd, \u201cclean out and wipe down your fridge regularly,\u201d especially if you\u2019ve had moldy items, Coffman added. Some molds are OK to eat, like in blue cheeses, Coffman said. Others can cause severe disease. A few molds can produce mycotoxins, which are toxins that make you sick, but most U.S. consumers aren\u2019t usually exposed to these kinds of molds, she added. Moldy foods may also have bacterial growth. It\u2019s this bacteria, not the mold itself, that usually causes foodborne illness, Coffman said. Should you throw away fruits and vegetables that have touched a rotten item? Food waste is a huge problem in the U.S. The average household wastes 32% of the food it purchases, costing consumers $240 billion a year, according to research published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics. So, it\u2019s not always necessary to throw away everything in your crisper or an entire package of strawberries just because you spot one moldy piece of produce, Coffman said.Advertisement\n\nIt can take a few days to a couple of weeks for fruits and vegetables to grow mold in the refrigerator or pantry, according to the Ultimate Mold Guide.Rok Stritof / EyeEm via Getty ImagesThese moldy strawberries may be beyond saving.But if you do see a moldy item, inspect neighboring fruits and vegetables for signs of mold (green or white fuzz) or spoilage (mushy texture or discoloration), Sims said. \u201cEvolution has given humans amazing instincts to tell if food is safe to eat,\u201d using sight, touch and smell, Regusci said. \u201cFirst, does it look good? No mold or cracks. Does it smell good? Not funky, unless you have purposely fermented or pickled it. Does it feel right? Not super mushy. Then it should taste right.\u201d Is it safe to eat produce that\u2019s had a moldy neighbor? Don\u2019t see mold growing on a fruit or vegetable that\u2019s been hanging out with a moldy item? You can usually wash the produce and eat it later. The USDA recommends washing produce under running tap water and avoiding using soap or detergent. Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of getting ill from one of the fresh items that have been touching a rotten one in the U.S. is low, especially if you are a person without underlying health conditions,\u201d Coffman said. People with mold allergies or compromised immune systems could be at risk for illness, though. The USDA mostly recommends throwing away foods that display mold but suggests that some foods can still be eaten if you remove the mold. For example, on firm fruits and vegetables with low moisture content, like cabbage, bell peppers and carrots, you can cut off at least an inch around and below a small mold spot. Just avoid touching the moldy spot with your knife so you don\u2019t cross-contaminate the produce. However, soft produce with high moisture content, like tomatoes, peaches and cucumbers, should be thrown away if they show mold. Coffman said mold on the surface can mean the \u201cmold has also rooted deeply below.\u201d If the food is contaminated with a mycotoxin-producing mold, the toxins spread throughout the item.Never sniff moldy items, as you could inhale the mold spores, which could cause respiratory illness. People can also get sick from skin contact with moldy foods, Coffman said. Advertisement\n\nKeep in mind, too, that just because the food looks OK or you\u2019ve removed the moldy bits, it could be unsafe to eat. Pathogens, like e.coli, listeria and salmonella, aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much you can do when inspecting produce at the grocery store to tell if it\u2019s harboring something that might make you sick,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cWhat you can do is wash your produce, cook it when possible and keep an eye out for recalls and public health notices.\u201d She also suggested keeping raw meats and other foods from cooked foods, washing your hands frequently while cooking and handling food, and placing a kitchen thermometer in the refrigerator to ensure it\u2019s set at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit to keep molds and bacteria from growing. \u201cIf you do end up accidentally eating something moldy and have an allergic reaction, seek medical help,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cSymptoms can include a sudden onset of shortness of breath, nausea, fever or diarrhea.\u201d Related...5 Questionable Food Additives That Are Banned In Europe But Allowed In The U.S.How Safe Is It To Eat Runny Egg Yolks?

From a young age, certain foods and ingredients would be woven into the stories that my father would tell me about his own formative years as a first-generation Mexican immigrant. He was second-to-youngest in a family of 16 that would travel around the country as migrant workers, following the crops and eating dishes resourcefully made from the fruits and vegetables that they would pick, utilizing the same cooking methods as their ancestors before them.  A bold-flavored salsa roja crafted using an ancient Mexican mortar and pestle isn\u2019t just something to eat with chips; it\u2019s the same salsa my grandmother would make. Husk-wrapped tamales, plump with filling and spices, will always be synonymous with family and Christmas. And a perfectly charred flour tortilla toasted on a comal is, in my opinion, truly the only way to enjoy one.    Once I moved out and lived on my own, I found myself holding on to the culinary traditions that I was raised with, partly out of comfort and partly out of pride for my heritage as a Latina.     In order to keep the magic and meaning of my culture\u2019s food alive, and more importantly, to share it with people that might not be familiar, I gathered the cooking gadgets of my childhood into the following list. Each of these tools are endowed with a deep-rooted history and have been used in the kitchens of Mexican households 100 times over, including my own.

This porous-textured bowl is used to grind down chiles, seeds and herbs in order to release oils from ingredients that add a true taste difference to dishes. I actually purchased this exact molcajete for my father after the one he inherited from my grandmother had gone completely smooth from decades' worth of use. It's authentically crafted with stone extracted from an extinct volcano in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, by local artisans.8-inch: $114.30 at Etsy4.5-inch: $71.10 at Etsy2AmazonA cast iron comal for the perfectly prepared tortillasIf you're microwaving your tortillas (or worse, eating them cold), respectfully, you're doing it wrong. A comal, which is a flat cast iron skillet, is the ideal way to give the perfect amount of warmth, char and flavor to both flour and corn tortillas. This 8-inch option offers a greater retention and distribution of heat and is nearly identical to the one that I have. Just place your tortilla on top of the heated surface until it gets small crispy pockets of air, making sure to heat both sides. Then, you have the perfect vessel for beans and rice or a delicious way to sop up runny egg yolks and crispy papas at breakfast time.$16.80 at Amazon3AmazonAn enamel-coated tamale steamerMaking homemade tamales is definitely a laborious endeavor, but for me, it's one that's worth taking. During the holidays I loved to watch my t\u00edas spend hours in the kitchen filling masa (a corn-based dough) with spiced tender meats before wrapping them in corn husks and steaming them in a pot similar to this. Although you definitely don't need a designated steamer to make tamales, it does make things easier and this 15-quart pot can also be useful for preparing other foods as well. It's double-coated in enamel, dishwasher-safe and resistant to corrosion.$39.38 at AmazonAdvertisement\n\n4Etsy/Mexico2UsTwo handwoven tortilla warmersAs I mentioned earlier, cold tortillas are just simply not it.

For even more heat retention, you can line these warmers with a kitchen towel and wrap your fresh-off-the-comal tortillas inside.$19 at Etsy5Etsy/Ibarraimports1A handmade clay pot for cooking beans and stocksThis handcrafted pot, or olla de barro, closely resembles the one my father often uses to simmer beans and make stocks that will flavor rice or caldo de res (my favorite Mexican dish of all time.) True to tradition, it's made using lead-free red clay and is loved for its ability to infuse flavors into its contents.$65+ at Etsy6AmazonA cast iron tortilla pressDon't get me wrong, store-bought tortillas were definitely a household staple growing up. However, on the occasion that the tortilla press was brought out, I knew it was going to be a good day. Making your own tortillas from scratch, especially corn, is actually easier than you might think and keeping a press like this one handy makes the process even easier.

If you (like me) live in a tiny studio apartment, or if your home is just short on storage, you\u2019re likely always wondering where to keep your clothes. When you don\u2019t have giant walk-in closets like the mega-rich people on reality TV shows, you need to get creative about your storage \u2014 and one way to do this is by stashing away your un-seasonal clothing when temperatures begin to change.\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a lot of closet space, putting out-of-season clothes away makes it a lot easier to keep track of what you have for each season,\u201d Catie Kelly, founder of Sistamatic Organizing, told HuffPost. \u201cAn overstuffed closet is so much harder to keep tidy!\u201dAdvertisement\n\nWhen preparing for seasonal storage, Kelly, who organized former \u201cReal Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams\u2019 current home, encourages you to think outside your closet. \u201cTake advantage of vertical spaces like walls and doors, and store as much as you can underneath couches and beds,\u201d she said. And although it may hurt to hear, she also suggests doing a major clothing purge. \u201cDecluttering is the most important step in any organizing journey, but it\u2019s especially vital when you don\u2019t have a lot of storage space,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe more aggressive you are about editing your belongings, the easier it is to get organized and stay organized.\u201dRuth Shafer, a tidying expert and certified KonMari consultant, concurred. \u201cNo amount of storage hacks or fabric bins or space savers will bring relief if your closet is full of items that make you feel guilty or not cute,\u201d Shafer said. Once you nail down the clothing you love and wear the most, you can strategically decide where to put it all. Haleema M. Burton, owner of Jillian & Leigh Home Organization, said seasonal changes are the perfect prompt for a closet clean-out. \u201cTaking the time to go through the process of storing your out-of-season clothes gives you a chance to assess your current wardrobe to see what you want to keep, donate or purge,\u201d Burton told HuffPost, \u201cwhile also helping you pre-plan your wardrobe needs for the next season.\u201d Advertisement\n\nTo help you find calm in your closet and to make storage seamless for your small space, Kelly, Shafer, Burton and other organization and wardrobe experts shared some of the best ways to organize your clothes. While some, like Burton, advocate for a full seasonal rotation of your closet, others, like Shafer, recommend keeping all clothing visible and together at all times \u2014 but they all suggest taking your time to find an organization method that you\u2019ll actually stick to.

Maximize your furniture WalmartMix clothes with your home decor\"Think out of the box with your furniture,\" said Alison Bruhn, wardrobe stylist and co-founder of The Style That Binds Us . \"Mix books and decorative objects with shoes, boots, sweaters, baskets and bags.\" Bruhn suggests finding useful pieces like this 12-compartment cubby to display your off-season clothes and shoes along side your plants or knick-knacks, making them part of the interior design of your space.$129 at WalmartAmazonSnag a bench that's not just a benchThough a trunk may sound like something you'd haul on a covered wagon, Bruhn says they're actually great, timeless pieces that can store off-season items with ease. \"Invest in a chest, trunk or ottoman that has storage inside,\" she suggested. This bench trunk has a padded leather top, with metal sides and a dark wood finish. Put it at the foot of your bed or near an entryway to create a space to put on shoes and hold all your off-season basics.$113.99 at AmazonWayfairOr a coffee table that's not only a coffee tableIf you live in a studio apartment or just want to conserve space, Bruhn recommends finding coffee or end tables with hidden storage, like this circular ottoman with a removable wooden top. \"These pieces of furniture can serve multiple purposes \u2014 [they] can hold sweaters inside and also be used as a coffee table,\" she said.$269.99 at AmazonAdvertisement\n\nWayfairSwap to a bed frame with built-in drawers\"You can invest in a bed that has storage built into it, like this one,\" Bruhn says. This minimal queen platform bed frame has three spacious drawers to hold out-of-season clothes.$319.99 at Wayfair2. Use vertical spaceTargetLet your storage hang outBurton's best tip? Utilizing vertical space. \"We don\u2019t often think about how much space is wasted by just using horizontal space,\" Burton said. \"Rethinking your space by going vertical increases your storage capacity.\"Burton recommended this six-shelf hanging unit with brown detailing. It can hold up to 40 pounds and comes with three pull-out drawers. \"Don\u2019t let vertical space go to waste,\" she said. \"Utilize the height of your space with hanging storage shelves with drawers.\"$36.99 at TargetAmazonUse whatever doors you haveYou may not have closets, but you likely have a door, whether it's for the bathroom or the entryway to your spot. Jessica Gelvin, founder and CEO of Space and Soul home organization, says this is often an overlooked storage space. \"I love using back-of-the-door hanging options like this one,\" Gelvin said. \"This [method] hides your things in plain sight and keeps them easily accessible without creating an eyesore.\" Kelly also suggested choosing over-door storage with mesh or clear sides. \"Clear fronts make it easy to see what\u2019s inside,\" she said.Mesh sides: $21.49 at AmazonClear sides:  $20.97 at AmazonAdvertisement\n\nWayfairGrab a standing clothing rack with drawersIf you have the floor space for a pop-up closet situation, Brun recommends this clothing rack-drawer combination from Wayfair, which lets you keep your favorite blouses or shirts visible and also has tucked-away drawers for things like socks and underwear. This rack has storage space on the top and bottom, so you can easily rotate the pieces you wear during seasonal changes.$265.99 at Wayfair (originally $339.99)WayfairInstall a hanging clothing rackIf you don't have the room for a whole standing clothing rack, Bruhn suggested installing a wall-mounted hanging rack. This keeps things off on the floor, and maximizes the way you use your wall space.$36.99 at Wayfair (originally $58.99)TargetReach for the starsIf you're going to be storing things in higher places, Burton encourages you to make hard-to-reach places as accessible as possible. \"A 2-3-step ladder is a very useful tool when maximizing your space when going vertical,\" she said. \"It helps to keep the storage accessories that are in higher places intact [and] in place instead of them falling or being placed on the floor.\"$25.99 at TargetAdvertisement\n\nAmazonLift your bedYour bed takes up a lot of room, so you might as well use it for storage. Kelly recommends these 7.25-inch bed risers that come with outlets and USB ports for easily charging your devices or plugging in a bed lamp. \"If your bed is too low to the ground to store things under it, bed risers like these will give you more height to work with!\" she said. \"If you don\u2019t want to see all that stuff underneath, a bed skirt is a good option.\"Kira Coopersmith, proprietor of Sensible Sort Professional Organizer, suggested wooden risers that have a warm, homey feel.Risers with outlets: $40.85 at AmazonWooden risers: $26.04 at Amazon3. Think inside the boxAmazonMake the most of your drawersRather than storing off-season clothes in different parts of your house, Shafer suggested bringing extreme organization to your drawers, which allows you to rotate items as needed while still keeping all your clothing in one area. She recommended setting shallow, straight-sided lidless boxes within your drawers (or wherever you keep your folded clothes) to best utilize the space. \"The purpose of storing clothing like this is so you can see everything you have, and so that nothing gets squished, forgotten, or wrinkled,\" she said. \"I rotate my warmer pieces to the front of the drawer in winter, and lighter pieces to the front in summer.\" This set of fabric organizer drawers comes in a set of 12 in eight colors.$21.96 at AmazonWest ElmStay in the clearWhen you don't have closet space, storage bins are your best friend. Yet, opaque fabric or dark plastic bins can be an invitation for chaos. \"Clear storage bins are a great organizational tool because they allow you to maximize storage space while keeping your items visible,\" Burton said. \"Consider using 2-3 clear storage bins on your closet floor or a shelf. Be sure to label them.\"Burton recommends these windowed fabric boxes from West Elm. The canvas fabrication makes them look homey, but clear siding allows you to identify your clothes.Gelvin echoed the need for visible storage, and recommended clear, stackable boxes with durable, latched lids (like these 5-quart ones from Iris) to keep your items protected.\"As someone who thrives with ADHD, I realized a while ago that out of sight truly meant out of mind,\" Gelvin said. \"When I store anything, it is easily accessible and identifiable. This works great for neurodiverse people like me, but it works great for neurotypical people as well because everyone benefits from a space that feels orderly. It helps reduce anxiety when you know where and how to find what you're looking for.\" Canvas box: $17.30 at West Elm (originally $35)Plastic storage bins: $42.29 at AmazonAdvertisement\n\nAmazonVacuum-seal bulky items\"Vacuum storage bags are a lifesaver for storing bulky things like coats,\" Kelly said. \"Once you suck the air out of the bag with either a vacuum or the included hand pump, even the fluffiest parka will be basically flat. They come in different sizes, so this variety pack is a good pace to start if you're not sure what sizes you need.\" Gelvin also recommends vacuum bags for seasonal storage, noting they can help organize linens and bulky bedding. \"You can store a lot more in a much smaller space using these bags, and they will also do a great job of protecting your sensitive fabrics from the elements during the storage season,\" she said. These Space Saver bags come in five sizes and include a hand or electric pump to help you vacuum seal on your own.$32.99+ at AmazonTargetRoll your stuff out of sight\"For those who don't already use the storage space under their beds, I highly suggest these under-bed rolling bins,\" Gelvin said. \"There's a bit of childlike fun that comes with rolling them out and flipping them open, and they make use of a space in your home that might otherwise be wasted or collecting dust.\" This rolling bin from Target has a latching top that's able to stack with other bins.$24.99 TargetTargetStore sweaters in a breathable fabric bin\"Most sweaters should be folded rather than hung in the off-season,\" said Coopersmith. She recommended storing knitwear in durable fabric bins \u2014 like this gray container from Target \u2014 instead of plastic ones. \"I think they do better in a fabric container (plastic can sweat) although you may need to use cedar balls inside the container to ward off moths and the like,\u201d she explained.$14 at TargetAdvertisement\n\n4. Streamline your closetAmazonSave space with hangersYour daily clothing space may contain a collection of old, mismatched hangers in different sizes. Gelvin said that this is likely a bit of an eyesore, and is taking up more space than it needs to. \"Ditch the old plastic hangers and get some matching cute hangers,\" she said. \"They help make your hanging space look more streamlined.\" Creating more room in your closet means there's more space for all of your clothes, and it's easy to rotate seasonal pieces.$39.42 at AmazonAnthropologieEmbrace hook-up cultureLooking for something that keeps your favorite pieces within reach while adding a little flair to your walls? Embrace the hook life. Both Shafer and Gelvin recommend placing hooks around your house for attractive, all-season storage.\"Not only do they decorate your wall, you can hang your hats, your cardigans, your jewelry, or anything else you're looking to organize,\" Gelvin said. Gelvin suggests finding stylish hooks from a retailer like Anthropologie.$18 at AnthropologieRelated...22 Products So Good Someone Literally Wrote A 5-Star Review This WeekMy Grandma Swears By This $13 Kitchen Tool For Perfect PiesI Regret To Inform You That This Daily Facial Exfoliator Is Ideal For Low-Maintenance Folks", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/small-space-storage-tips-professional-organizers_l_632486c3e4b0eac9f4e1459e", "title": "How To Store Your Off-Season Clothes When You Have No Closets"}, {"authors": "HuffPost's Branded Creative Team", "date_publish": "Sep 7, 2022, 03:42 PM EDT", "description": "Marriott Bonvoy Boundless\u00ae Credit CardMarriottReady to travel again?

Sports Hall of Fame at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. where the Washington Nationals defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 4-1. (Photo by Mark Goldman/Icon Sportswire/Corbis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Icon Sports Wire via Getty ImagesLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Maury Wills, who intimidated pitchers with his base-stealing prowess as a shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers on three World Series championship teams, has died. He was 89.Wills died Monday night at home in Sedona, Arizona, the team said Tuesday after being informed by family members. No cause of death was given.Advertisement\n\nWills played on World Series title teams in 1959, \u201963 and \u201965 during his first eight seasons with the Dodgers. He also played for Pittsburgh and Montreal before returning to the Dodgers from 1969-72, when he retired.During his 14-year career, Wills batted .281 with 2,134 hits and 586 stolen bases in 1,942 games.Wills broke Ty Cobb\u2019s single-season record for stolen bases with his 97th swipe on Sept. 23, 1962. That season he became the first player to steal more than 100 bases.The Dodgers will wear a patch in memory of Wills for the rest of this season.\u201cMaury Wills was one of the most exciting Dodgers of all time,\u201d team president and CEO Stan Kasten said. \u201cHe changed baseball with his base-running and made the stolen base an important part of the game. He was very instrumental in the success of the Dodgers with three world championships.\u201dWills had an ill-fated stint managing the Seattle Mariners from 1980-81, going 26-56 with a winning percentage of .317.Advertisement\n\nHe was the National League Most Valuable Player in 1962, the same year he was MVP of the All-Star Game played in his hometown of Washington, D.C.Wills stayed at home with his family instead of at the team hotel for the All-Star Game. He arrived at the ballpark carrying a Dodgers bag and wearing a Dodgers shirt. However, the security guard wouldn\u2019t let him in, saying he was too small to be a ballplayer.Wills suggested the guard escort him to the NL clubhouse door, where he would wait while the guard asked the players to confirm his identity.\u201cSo we walk down there and baseball players have a sick sense of humor, because when I stood in front of the door, with my Dodger shirt and duffel bag, and the man opened the door and said, \u2018Anybody in here know this boy?\u2019 and they all looked at me and said, \u2019Never saw him before,\u201d Wills told The Washington Post in 2015.After the game, Wills left with his MVP trophy and showed it to the guard.\u201cHe still didn\u2019t believe me, he thought maybe I was carrying it for somebody,\u201d Wills told the Post.Wills led the NL in stolen bases from 1960-65, was a seven-time All-Star selection and won Gold Glove Awards in 1961 and \u201962.Advertisement\n\nHe was credited with reviving the stolen base as a strategy. His speed made him a constant threat on the basepaths and he distracted pitchers even if he didn\u2019t try to steal. He carefully studied pitchers and their pickoff moves when he wasn\u2019t on base. When a pitcher\u2019s throw drove him back to the bag, he became even more determined to steal.Once, in a game against the New York Mets, Wills was on first base when pitcher Roger Craig threw 12 straight times to the bag. On Craig\u2019s next throw, Wills stole second.By age 32, Wills was bandaging his legs before games because of the punishment of sliding.After retiring with the Dodgers in 1972, Wills worked an analyst at NBC for five years. He also managed winter ball in the Mexican Pacific League, winning a league championship in 1970-71.Wills\u2019 tenure managing the Mariners was largely regarded as a disaster and he was criticized for his lack of managerial experience. It was evident in the numerous gaffes he committed, including calling for a relief pitcher when nobody was warming up in the bullpen and holding up a game for several minutes while looking for a pinch hitter.Wills\u2019 biggest mistake came on April 25, 1981, when he ordered the Mariners\u2019 ground crew to extend the batter\u2019s box a foot longer toward the mound than regulation allowed. Oakland manager Billy Martin noticed and asked home plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate.Advertisement\n\nKunkel questioned the head groundskeeper, who admitted Wills had ordered the change. Wills said it was to help his players stay in the box. However, Martin suspected it was to give the Mariners an advantage against Oakland\u2019s breaking-ball pitchers. Wills was suspended for two games by the American League and fined $500.Wills led the Mariners to a 20-38 record to end the 1980 season, and he was fired on May 6, 1981, when the team was mired in last place at 6-18. Years later, Wills admitted he probably should have gotten more experience as a minor league manager before being hired in the big leagues.Wills struggled with addictions to alcohol and cocaine until getting sober in 1989. He credited Dodgers pitching great Don Newcombe, who overcame his own alcohol problems, with helping him. Newcombe died in 2109.\u201cI\u2019m standing here with the man who saved my life,\u201d Wills said of Newcombe. \u201cHe was a channel for God\u2019s love for me because he chased me all over Los Angeles trying to help me and I just couldn\u2019t understand that. But he persevered, he wouldn\u2019t give in and my life is wonderful today because of Don Newcombe.\u201dBorn Maurice Morning Wills in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 2, 1932, he was a three-sport standout at Cardozo Senior High. He earned All-City honors as a quarterback in football, in basketball and as a pitcher in baseball when he was nicknamed Sonny.Advertisement\n\nIn 1948, he played on the school\u2019s undefeated football team, which never gave up any points. On the mound, Wills threw a one-hitter and struck out 17 in a game in 1950. The school\u2019s baseball field is named in his honor.Wills has his own museum in Fargo, North Dakota, where he was a coach and instructor for the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks from 1996-97.He is survived by wife Carla, and children Barry, Micki, Bump, Anita, Susan Quam and Wendi Jo Wills. Bump was a former major league second baseman who played for Texas and the Chicago Cubs.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsRelated...These States Had Few, If Any, Trans Student Athletes.

But in her latest project, \u201cOn the Come Up,\u201d we get to see things from Lathan\u2019s lens as she makes her directorial debut and also stars as Jay, the mother of up-and-coming teen rapper Bri. Advertisement\n\nLathan was eager to take on this project, which is based on Angie Thomas\u2019 YA novel of the same name. So much so that she said it was reminiscent of how she felt when she landed her first starring role.\u201cIt was between me and like three other directors,\u201d Lathan told HuffPost. \u201cBut when I finally got the part of director, I cried like I cried when I got \u2018Love & Basketball.\u2019\u201dIn the film, 16-year-old Bri is hoping to follow in her late father\u2019s footsteps by using battle rap as a platform to make a name for herself. Bri has a complicated relationship with her mom, Jay, stemming from Jay\u2019s addiction to heroin. Though Jay has recovered from her addiction, life begins to take a turn when financial pressures, police brutality and the possibility of losing her daughter arrive at her doorstep. Lathan said she knew the script was good as soon as she started reading it. The women in the story captured her heart almost instantly. Advertisement\n\n\u201cI was captivated by Bri. I saw a lot of my younger self in Bri. I saw a lot of women that I know and love in Jay and Pooh. And I loved the whole idea of a coming-of-age story about a little girl in the world of battle rap,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really seen that. And battle rap is a whole \u2019nother genre of hip-hop that to me is fascinating and still very much alive today. And there were so many elements that made me excited about telling it.\u201dThough it was a challenge to wear two hats for the film, Lathan was by no means unfamiliar with what goes into directing. Her father is award-winning director Stan Lathan. Dreams of stepping behind the camera started to pop up early for her, and she studied film while attending Yale School of Drama for graduate school. Acknowledging that she probably had more experience on set than a lot of filmmakers, she started mentoring directors about seven years ago. It was then that Lathan realized she had a lot to offer. So she started studying with a director of photography. During the pandemic, she directed her first film \u2014 a short that was never released, starring her dog in her home.

She leaned on her dad and \u201cLove & Basketball\u201d director Gina Prince-Bythewood for advice, especially when it came to the business and finance side. Her dad watched a few rough cuts and attended the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September. \u201cIt just makes me just so happy to see him so happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s as awed as I am at the fact that I\u2019m on this journey now.\u201dLathan realized that the perfect storm of the coronavirus pandemic, Black Lives Matter movement, Time\u2019s Up, the rise of streaming, and the demand for greater representation in Hollywood set the stage for her to finally step into a dream that\u2019s been a long time coming. And \u201cOn the Come Up\u2019 couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for her directorial debut, according to Lathan.\u201cOne of the beauties of this film is what is so familiar to me, is that the women are the backbones of a lot of families. The community of women raises generations up, and this is kind of an homage to that family,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grandmother and my aunts and cousins, they raised us all, and that\u2019s a very common thing. And I want women to recognize that and feel like they are being seen in that respect. As well as the journey of Bri stepping into her power, through finding out her authentic voice. That is a message that men, women, old, young, every race, that can be held by everyone.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nLathan, of course, plans on continuing acting as she reunites with the original cast of \u201cBest Man\u201d for the spin-off series premiering later this year on Peacock. But she also plans to keep directing for at least the next few years, if not longer.\u201cI just want to continue to tell stories that challenge me as an actor, as a director,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hone my vision as a director and hone my skills and just continue to tell these stories, and hopefully, people will connect.\u201dRelated...'The Woman King' Immortalizes Black Female Warriors On ScreenGina Prince-Bythewood Reflects On \u2018Love & Basketball\u2019 20 Years Later9 Movies That Changed The Way We Think About Black Love", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sanaa-lathan-on-the-come-up_n_6328c6ffe4b0cd3ec260759c", "title": "Sanaa Lathan Makes Her Directorial Debut With \u2018On The Come Up\u2019"}, {"authors": "AP", "date_publish": "Sep 20, 2022, 01:16 PM EDT", "description": "After a year spent off air, the Golden Globe Awards are returning to NBC in January", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "After a year spent off air, the Golden Globe Awards are returning to NBC in January. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)via Associated PressNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a year spent off-air, the Golden Globe Awards are returning to NBC in January, when the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association will seek a primetime comeback.NBC, the Hollywood Press Association and dick clark productions on Tuesday made the Globes\u2019 return official. The 80th Golden Globes will be held January 10, airing both on NBC and Peacock.Advertisement\n\nFor the past year and half, Hollywood has effectively boycotted the Globes, for years one of the most-watched award shows after the Academy Awards. But after the Los Angeles Times reported ahead of the 2021 broadcast that the HFPA\u2019s 87 members of non-American journalists included no Black members, studios, publicists and stars said they would cease participating in the Globes. Tom Cruise returned his three Golden Globe awards.Since then, the HFPA has reorganized itself, revamped its membership and enacted reforms designed to curtail the kinds of unethical behavior the group has long been criticized for. The HFPA added new members, including six Black voting members, and recently added 103 international, nonmember voters. The HFPA on Tuesday said their voting body is now 52% female, 19.5% Latino, 12% Asian, 10% Black and 10% Middle Eastern.\u201cWe recognize the HFPA\u2019s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th Anniversary in January 2023,\u201d said Frances Berwick, chairman of entertainment networks for NBCUniversal.NBC had reason to want to get the Globes back on the air. In 2018, the network signed an eight-year deal to continue airing the awards through 2026. Citing the HFPA\u2019s ongoing reforms, NBC elected not to televise the previous Golden Globes in January. The organization went ahead announcing awards, anyway, in an untelevised and little-noticed gathering unattended by nominees.Advertisement\n\nThis year\u2019s ceremony, the organizations said, will be broadcast in a one-year agreement. Terms were unavailable but the deal is expected to be less than the approximately $60 million the network previously paid annually to air the Globes. With backlash swirling and the ceremony scaled down because of the pandemic, the 2021 Globes were watched by 6.9 million people, according to Nielsen, down from more than 18 million the year before.Whether NBC\u2019s endorsement will be enough to return the Globes to Hollywood\u2019s good graces, however, remains to be seen. Nominations to the Globes will be announced Dec. 12.The HFPA is currently being run by interim Chief Executive Todd Boehly, whose investment firm, Eldridge Industries, bought the Globes and turned it from a nonprofit into a for-profit venture. Boehly\u2019s firm is also the parent company of dick clark productions, the awards\u2019 producer, and the owner of the Globes\u2019 longtime home, the Beverly Hilton.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAPRelated...Jane Fonda Demands RepresentationTom Cruise Gives Golden Globes The Ultimate Diss As NBC Cancels Awards ShowNBC Won't Air 2022 Golden Globes Amid HFPA ControversyTime's Up Slams Golden Globes For 'Simplistic' Response To Having Zero Black Members Go To HomepageSuggest a correctionMore: Los Angeles TimesamericanHollywood Foreign Press Association80th Golden GlobesNBC Hollywood Press AssociationPopular in the Community", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/golden-globes-return-nbc_n_6329f151e4b0ed991abda7f3", "title": "Golden Globes Returning To NBC In January After Year Off-Air"}, {"authors": "AP", "date_publish": "Sep 20, 2022, 11:11 AM EDT", "description": "Alan Eugene Miller, seen after arrested in 1991 for carrying out a workplace shooting that killed three men, has said that he requested nitrogen as his execution method rather than lethal injection", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Alan Eugene Miller, seen after arrested in 1991 for carrying out a workplace shooting that killed three men, has said that he requested nitrogen as his execution method rather than lethal injection.Dave Martin via APMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Monday blocked Alabama from executing an inmate who says the state lost his paperwork requesting an alternative to lethal injection.U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker, Jr. issued a preliminary injunction to block the state from executing Alan Miller on Thursday by any method other than nitrogen hypoxia, an untested method Miller says he requested but Alabama is not ready to use. Miller was sentenced to die after being convicted of killing three people in a 1999 workplace shooting.Advertisement\n\n\u201cMiller will likely suffer irreparable injury if an injunction does not issue because he will be deprived of the ability to die by the method he chose and instead will be forced to die by a method he sought to avoid and which he asserts will be painful,\u201d Huffaker wrote. The injury will be, \u201cthe loss of his \u2018final dignity\u2019\u2014to choose how he will die,\u201d the judge added.The ruling blocks Alabama from carrying out the lethal injection that had been set for Thursday. However, the Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall will appeal the decision, Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, wrote in an email.Alabama told a federal judge last year that it has finished construction of a \u201csystem\u201d to put condemned inmates to death using nitrogen gas. Miller, seen in an undated photo, has said that he'd prefer nitrogen gas because he dislikes needles. via APNitrogen hypoxia is a proposed execution method in which death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, thereby depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions. Nitrogen hypoxia has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but no state has attempted to put an inmate to death by the untested method.Advertisement\n\nWhen Alabama approved nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative execution method in 2018, state law gave inmates a brief window to designate it as their execution method.Miller testified last week that he returned a state form selecting nitrogen on the same day it was distributed to inmates by a prison worker. He said he left it in the slot of his cell door for a prison worker to collect, but did not see who picked it up. Miller described how he disliked needles because of painful attempts at drawing blood. He said the nitrogen method reminded him of the nitrous oxide gas used at dentist offices, and that seemed better than lethal injection.\u201cI did not want to be stabbed with a needle,\u201d Miller said.Alabama prison officials say they have no record of Miller returning the form, and argued that Miller is just trying to delay his execution.Huffaker wrote that he can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Miller is lying about selecting nitrogen in order to delay his looming execution, but said his testimony was credible. \u201cIt is substantially likely that Miller timely elected nitrogen hypoxia,\u201d the judge wrote.The judge noted the possibility that Alabama might soon be able to use nitrogen. \u201cFrom all that appears, the State intends to announce its readiness to conduct executions by nitrogen hypoxia in the upcoming weeks,\u201d the judge wrote.Advertisement\n\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections told the judge last week that Alabama \u201chas completed many of the preparations necessary for conducting executions by nitrogen hypoxia\u201d but is not ready to implement it.Miller, a delivery truck driver, was convicted in the 1999 workplace shootings that killed Lee Holdbrooks, Scott Yancy and Terry Jarvis in suburban Birmingham. Miller shot Holdbrooks and Yancy at one business and then drove to another location to shoot Jarvis, evidence showed.A defense psychiatrist said Miller was delusional and suffered from severe mental illness but his condition wasn\u2019t bad enough to use as a basis for an insanity defense under state law.Related...Alabama Says It Could Use Untried Execution Method On Inmate Next Week Go To HomepageSuggest a correctionMore:Alabamalethal injectionexecutionAlan Eugene MillerPopular in the Community", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/judge-halts-alabama-alan-miller-execution_n_6329d4d4e4b0bfdf5e1a9ab4", "title": "Judge Blocks Upcoming Lethal Injection Of Alabama Inmate"}, {"authors": "David Moye", "date_publish": "2022-09-19T20:14:48-0400", "description": "An executive of a popular plant-based meat company has been arrested for allegedly biting another man\u2019s nose", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "An executive of a popular plant-based meat company has been arrested for allegedly biting another man\u2019s nose.Doug Ramsey, 53, the COO of Beyond Meat, was arrested Saturday in Fayetteville, Arkansas, after a man said Ramsey bit him in the nose in a parking garage after a college football game, according to local news station KNWA.Advertisement\n\nA responding police officer said he found \u201ctwo males with bloody faces\u201d at the scene, one of whom was later identified as Ramsey.According to KNWA, citing a police report, Ramsey was attempting to leave the garage in a Bronco when a Subaru inched its way in front of his vehicle.After the Subaru reportedly touched the Bronco\u2019s front passenger-side tire, Ramsey got out of the vehicle and  \u201cpunched through the back windshield of the Subaru,\u201d KNWA reported.The Subaru\u2019s owner told police that when he got out of the car, Ramsey \u201cpulled him in close and started punching his body.\u201d Ramsey is also accused of biting the other man\u2019s nose, \u201cripping the flesh on the tip of the nose,\u201d and threatening to kill him, according to the man and witnesses who spoke to police.Advertisement\n\nRamsey was taken into custody at the Washington County Jail, where he was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery.

Goldman\u2019s more left-leaning opponents branded him a flip-flopper on abortion policy and a \u201cconservative Democrat\u201d whose investment of $4 million of his own money amounted to an effort to \u201cbuy\u201d the election.Advertisement\n\nBut after narrowly defeating New York state Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou in a 12-person race for the Democratic nomination on Aug. 23, Goldman is trying to build a bridge to the left rather than dwell on his grievances with them.\u201cI am very well aware that we got 26% of the vote,\u201d Goldman told HuffPost in an interview on Sept. 12. \u201cI am excited about reaching out to many people, who may not have supported me, to see if we can work together.\u201d Goldman, a former federal prosecutor and heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune who led House Democrats\u2019 impeachment of then-President Donald Trump in 2019, made it clear that progressive New Yorkers are at the top of his outreach list.\u201cIn a short campaign where I endured false attacks, I am excited to share my progressive values and ideals with so many in this district who I believe have a misconception of who I am and where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first order of business is to do that outreach, and I\u2019ve already started to do it.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nGoldman said he is already speaking to New York City Comptroller Brad Lander on a regular basis. Lander, one of the city\u2019s most influential progressives and a resident of the 10th District, did not endorse anyone in the primary but subsequently revealed to HuffPost that he had voted for Niou.\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody that I\u2019m not reaching out to, any groups that I\u2019m not reaching out to,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cI look forward to sitting down with the Working Families Party and finding what I believe to be a lot of common ground to work together as we go forward.\u201dGoldman still has a general election to win against Republican nominee Benine Hamdan. But in a lower Manhattan and Brooklyn-based district where President Joe Biden received 85% of the 2020 vote, that race is expected to be little more than a formality.Goldman said he has already begun helping raise funds for other Democratic candidates with more competitive general elections. He is committed to pitching in significantly to help Democrats hold the U.S. House and to help New York Democrats maintain their supermajorities in the state Assembly and the state Senate.Among his primary rivals, Goldman said, he had already spoken with New York City Council member Carlina Rivera, former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman and New York state Assembly member Jo Anne Simon. Simon formally endorsed Goldman on Monday. Rivera and Goldman have been in touch as part of their shared relief efforts for residents of the Jacob Riis Houses, a public housing development whose residents were mistakenly informed in late August that their drinking water contained arsenic.Advertisement\n\nGoldman had not heard from Niou or Rep. Mondaire Jones, who formed a united front to attack Goldman in the final week of the primary race. Niou considered running on the Working Families Party ballot line against Goldman in the general election but decided against it.Dan Goldman, a former federal prosecutor, addresses supporters after declaring victory in the Democratic primary on Aug. 23. His general-election race is not considered competitive.Craig Ruttle/Associated PressAsked whether he would like to have Niou\u2019s endorsement, Goldman said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201dWhy not?\u201cI\u2019m more interested in getting the endorsement and the support of groups that I am going to have a continuing and ongoing working relationship with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Yuh-Line will be out of office after this term.\u201dIn an interview with New York magazine, Niou would not say whether she plans to reach out to Goldman but implied that she would be receptive to hearing from him. \u201cI am a public servant. I still have an office available,\u201d she said. \u201cBut nobody\u2019s reached out to me yet.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAfter HuffPost published this article, Niou responded to Goldman\u2019s remarks with a statement.\u201cI hope Dan Goldman realizes as a representative and a public servant that one should have an \u2018continuing and ongoing working relationship\u2019 with all constituents (even those that can\u2019t vote) and that everyone in the district, even folks they don\u2019t agree with, should be provided services and access and transparency ... even/especially non-elected officials,\u201d she said.Ironically, Goldman agrees with Niou on one of the most contentious issues in the district. Both Democrats oppose approving the construction of Haven Green, an affordable housing development for LGBTQ seniors in lower Manhattan that would be built in a lot now occupied by the Elizabeth Street Garden.\u201cI have said I don\u2019t think we should be pitting green space against affordable housing. And that both are too scarce in this city,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cWe should be taking every step possible not to sacrifice one for the other.\u201dGoldman expressed optimism that a neighborhood governing body had already identified a more suitable site for the building. If such a site still proved unworkable, he said, \u201cwe\u2019d have to reassess.\u201dOn at least two other hot-button housing policy questions, Goldman declined to outline his position. Asked whether he agrees with the real estate industry\u2019s criticism of a 2019 state law strengthening rent regulations and whether there should be greater restrictions on private equity firms\u2019 ownership of rental properties, Goldman said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment before I understand it.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Goldman elicited progressive scrutiny for other reasons during the campaign. Among other departures from left-wing orthodoxy, he opposed \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and was skeptical of canceling student loan debt.Now Goldman downplays those differences. Unlike, say, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), Goldman would not describe his win as a victory for mainstream Democrats and a defeat for more hard-line progressive ideology. \u201cWhat I found during the campaign is people got very hung up on semantics and less about the fact that we are all \u2015 every single top candidate in this race \u2015 seeking broadly the same objectives.\u201d- Dan Goldman, Democratic nominee, New York's 10th Congressional District\u201cTo the extent that [the outcome] is a reflection of anything, it is a recognition of the importance of our democratic values and foundations to everything else that we want to accomplish,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cAnd it is also a reflection of the desire of many, including many Democrats, who want to see results.\u201d\u201cWhat I found during the campaign is people got very hung up on semantics and less about the fact that we are all \u2015 every single top candidate in this race \u2015 seeking broadly the same objectives,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the question is: How can we get to a place where every American has access to free health care? How can we get to a place where climate change is reducing, not increasing? How can we get to a place where we are providing more affordable housing and lowering rents? How can we get to a place where we\u2019re expanding access to abortion, where we\u2019re increasing gun control? We all believe in that.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nGoldman also said he approved of Biden\u2019s cancellation of the first $10,000 in student debt held by people earning less than $125,000 a year. \u201cIt\u2019s a good first step, in part because the disparate impact of the student loan crisis on poor, underserved, minority communities is addressed most substantially by the first $10,000 of student debt relief,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cBut I think that we need to continue to do more to ensure that those who have suffered from predatory lending schemes by for-profit institutions and others who were not provided full and accurate information receive the relief that they deserve.\u201dHe supports making community colleges free to address the rising cost of a college degree. But he did not respond when asked about reexamining the income tax exemption afforded to nonprofit private universities that boast multibillion-dollar endowments and continue to increase tuition year after year.The biggest error of Goldman\u2019s campaign was creating ambiguity about exactly where he stood on abortion rights in an interview with the Orthodox Jewish news outlet Hamodia. He implied that he was fine with state governments prohibiting abortion after the point of fetal viability \u2015 but walked it back moments later after consulting with an aide.Many of Goldman\u2019s rivals attacked him for the remarks, though none more so than Jones, who cast doubt on Goldman\u2019s pro-choice credentials in TV and digital ads.Advertisement\n\nI asked Goldman whether he thought those attacks hurt him and contributed to the narrowness of his win.\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat everybody says about negative attacks is that it hurts the target but it also hurts the proponent of them, and I think that probably happened to some extent here.\u201dGoldman again clarified that, in the Hamodia interview, he had been trying to articulate a legal opinion about what kinds of state laws were permissible under the legal framework of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision that had established a Constitutional right to abortion. One such law, he noted, is the Reproductive Health Act, which Democrats in the New York state legislature adopted in 2019.\u201cIf we are talking normatively, it should just be a decision made for the woman and her doctor, under the best medical advice, not what the government says should or should not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we are presented with legislation that is based on legal standards set forth in Roe \u2015 [prohibiting abortion after fetal viability] with exceptions for the health of the mother and the health of the baby \u2015 then I would not object to that and I would vote for it.\u201dCurrently, New York state prohibits abortion after fetal viability unless the life or health of the mother is threatened. Goldman said he would support legislation that allows abortion without exceptions.Advertisement\n\nFinally, Goldman would not say whether his self-funding made his victory possible. He insisted that he was operating within the confines of the current system and that he supports a complete overhaul of campaign-finance laws, including through the adoption of public financing.\u201cThe money in politics is, broadly speaking, corrupting, and we should do everything that we can to get rid of it,\u201d Goldman said.\u201cI actually think self-funding is probably the least of the problems, because I\u2019m not beholden to any special interest groups,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not beholden to any donors. The only people that I\u2019m beholden to are the voters.\u201dRelated...Democrats Launch Massive Negative Ad Campaign Against GOP On AbortionWhy The Inflation Reduction Act Boosted Democrats While The Infrastructure Law FailedThe Longest-Serving Congresswoman Could Lose To A Jan. 6 Rallier", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dan-goldman-outreach-progressive-democrats-us-house-race-new-york-city_n_63292457e4b0cd3ec260ad34", "title": "U.S. House Nominee Dan Goldman Extending An Olive Branch To Progressive Critics In NYC"}, {"authors": "Ed Mazza", "date_publish": "2022-09-20T00:38:44-0400", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel tore into Donald Trump\u2019s open embrace of the QAnon conspiracy theory at this latest rally, which featured the music associated with the movement", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Jimmy Kimmel tore into Donald Trump\u2019s open embrace of the QAnon conspiracy theory at this latest rally, which featured the music associated with the movement.

I mean that is unfair to the child.That social media comment was plopped amid a feed of so many heart emojis and encouraging songs of praise after I published an essay on HuffPost Personal in January. The piece had been my first chance to offer the world a glimpse at what it was like to be pregnant and paralyzed. I was so proud! And then I saw that comment.Advertisement\n\nUnfair to the child. I told myself that it was just one out of so many responses \u2015 the majority of them heart-eye faces and yellow thumbs-ups \u2015 but as hard as I tried, I couldn\u2019t ignore it.I\u2019ve heard comments like that my whole life, most of them unintentional criticisms of the thing I have no control over. I was in a car accident in my teens. I flew through the air and landed on the highway pavement, pulling and stretching my spinal cord beyond repair. My whole world changed in the time that it takes to sigh at a really negative comment.However, in the last 25 years, I have done so much for myself to be able to accomplish whatever I have in my sights. I became a teacher and a swim coach. I traveled across the globe despite unruly backroads and seemingly inaccessible lifestyles. I challenged myself beyond what I knew was possible by training for the Paralympics. I even became a wife and a mom.Because I\u2019ve been paralyzed and a wheelchair user for the last quarter century, it is all that I know at this point, and it is certainly all that my children know. I am who I am because of my disability, and my children know who they are too. When I became pregnant with my first child, I realized that I was going to have to find a path for \u2015 and by \u2015 myself. There was no learner\u2019s permit, no manual, no guide to tell or show me how things would go.Advertisement\n\nFortunately, I am as stubborn as a mule wearing high heels in the rain. I wasn\u2019t going to budge on the notion that things happen for a reason, and I determined to help them happen.The author with her son Van on the ferry from Vancouver to Victoria in 2019.Courtesy of Ryan Rae HarbuckI\u2019ve had two children without any remarkable medical intervention. I am extremely proud of my body and its willingness to stand in that rain wearing high heels, proclaiming that it all can be done.Don\u2019t get me wrong: A little voice inside of me began snaking through my cerebrum the very moment that I became pregnant. It judged me and made me doubt my capabilities \u2015 or rather handi-capabilites \u2015 of becoming and being a mother. I vividly remember looking down at the pregnancy test, alongside my husband in our tiny bathroom. We were all full-teethed smiles, yet that serpent slithered right in and hissed, \u201cSssssssssssso, how will you even teach him how to walk?\u201dI honestly didn\u2019t know. But what I was sure of was that I have always been blessed with the willingness to try. I suppose that feeling may ring true for many parents.Advertisement\n\nI have to climb high into that tree because my child is stuck? No problem. Jump in front of a moving vehicle to catch a toddling toddler? I got this.I\u2019m guessing every parent has known what it\u2019s like to forget themselves for the sake of their little ones, and I am no exception. I knew \u2015 I just knew \u2015 I would figure out how to teach my kiddo to walk and fly across the monkey bars and do all of those things that I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine doing for myself. Because I\u2019m their mom.I have learned to challenge my body with car seats and strollers, with staircases and soccer practice carpools \u2015 even when I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll pull off whatever challenge is in front of me \u2015 and I\u2019ve succeeded. I have learned to try with everything I\u2019ve got, and I have learned to ask for help. I have even learned to ask my kids for help, because sometimes that\u2019s OK too.As my children grew, I grew too.The author and her son Orren on Halloween in 2019.Courtesy of Ryan Rae HarbuckI have been gifted so much perspective about my disability and life with it from watching my kids watch me. I didn\u2019t know that I was so strong before they told and showed me so. Advertisement\n\nBeing able to wrap up just a little sliver of my own experience for them is everything to me. They have been privy to learning about things like the purest of empathy, overcoming adversities, challenging norms, and so many other beautiful and instinctive attributes that I believe every parent would want their children to possess.When my firstborn was just a toddler, we went out for a walk around the block together \u2014 just us. I had taught him so many times before that he needed to walk right next to my wheelchair wheel, since it has never been possible to hold hands while crossing a street. He was always obedient to those commands because he understood their importance. However, that day, while out strolling around the neighborhood, my sweet boy did something that I will never forget. There was a slight incline in the sidewalk, and before I could even kneel my chest towards my legs to get the appropriate grip to wheel myself up the hill, my son came up behind me and offered a gentle push, just as he had seen his daddy do so many times before.He gave me just enough help to get up that hill, and he didn\u2019t expect or need a gold star or any kind of reward. He did it because he just knew it was the right thing to do. And, for the first time in my whole life, I realized how special my disability made me \u2015 made him.There are so many lessons that have been whispered to each of my children because of my wheelchair. There will be so many more.For Mother\u2019s Day this year, my 8-year-old son made me a card that included two poems written in his best curly handwriting \u2015 because curly handwriting is fancy. The last line of his second poem reads, \u201c[Mom] reaches the unbelievable.\u201d How beautiful is that?Advertisement\n\nThe author with her sons.Courtesy of Ryan Rae HarbuckIs my life \u2015 are our lives together \u2015 all curly handwritten odes? Certainly not. Being paralyzed and having to use a wheelchair puts so much strain on my physical body and my physical health and I am in a near-constant state of dizzy thinking about how this affects my health and my longevity. I sometimes wonder will I always be there for them as they grow? I don\u2019t know. But I only let myself worry about this for a second because worrying won\u2019t do me \u2015 or my family \u2015 any good, and I have more important things to concentrate on.Are there moments where I just can\u2019t be there for them or with them? Those moments when I have to shoo my boys and my husband to go on without me across a suspension bridge in the rocky forests of British Columbia, or run down the highest sandhill at White Sands National Monument?Of course.Those moments are becoming more frequent as my sons get older and they become more adventurous and mobile. But I have created a very special pocket in my chest for those times, and I hold those moments close when I\u2019m alone. Those moments are filled with the most bittersweet silences.My paralysis cannot take me everywhere I want to go \u2015 I\u2019ve always known that. There will be times when my kids have to go on without me. There will be things that I miss.Advertisement\n\nYet they always return to me with giant smiles and stories to share. I am not forgotten. I am missed. I am loved. And they are loved \u2015 and they know it. And I wouldn\u2019t trade what we have for anything in the world.Ryan Rae Harbuck is the author of her memoir \u201cWhen I Grow Up I Want to Be a Chair.\u201d She has been a teacher and a swim coach but enjoys being Mom the most.

When I was a kid, I begged my parents for a subscription to the Time Life \u201cMysteries Of The Unknown\u201d book series and spent hours paging through the thin, hardbound black books and gawking at blurry photos of Big Foot and fuzzy, unexplained lights hovering in formation over some lonely mesa in New Mexico.But the volume I found most captivating was about mediums. The idea that a person could function as a mystical transistor radio and pick up messages from the afterworld thrilled and terrified me. I was especially fascinated by a woman who had lived a century earlier and had ceremoniously oozed ectoplasm from her orifices \u2015 sometimes in the shape of a gooey hand or even someone\u2019s face \u2015 whenever she spoke with the dead.Advertisement\n\nI had so many questions: Could we really come back, even if just for a few seconds, in the form of a mysterious, garbled memo beamed into the head of someone with the ability to pick up these ghostly radio waves, and if so, what would we say? What would it feel like to hear them \u2015 to be reached by someone who had left Earth but hadn\u2019t entirely left their earthly life behind?Determined to find out, I tried to initiate conversations with spirits in my bedroom before I fell asleep. I\u2019d offer up an open invitation to whoever or whatever might be floating by our house, whispering, \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone here who wants to talk to me, I\u2019m listening! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201dI was never completely sure if I was trying to convince the ghosts or myself that there was nothing to be afraid of. I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if one actually showed up or, heaven help me, I started dripping ectoplasm from my ears, but it didn\u2019t really matter because I never got a response.Because I still wanted to be part of this strange, magical world that I hoped but wasn\u2019t entirely persuaded existed, I decided that if I couldn\u2019t be a medium, I would study them, and I wrote to the parapsychology institute at Duke University about my plan. This was the \u201980s, years before our culture\u2019s current infatuation with the paranormal, and some sweet research assistant was kind enough to indulge this 10-year-old weirdo by mailing me a few crudely photocopied studies about psychokinesis and remote viewing, none of which I understood.Advertisement\n\nThe author (right), age 6, with his brother and cousin.Courtesy of Noah MichelsonBy the time I got to college, I realized I had no apparent extrasensory abilities and I wasn\u2019t good enough at science or math to earn a spot at a foundation attempting to prove that life exists after death, so I began indulging in my only other option: visiting psychics.My first experience was at a shop in downtown Minneapolis when I was 18. It had a neon crystal ball glowing in its window and a weathered sandwich board sign offering a $10 reading leaning next to its door. When I finally got the courage to go inside, I found a middle-aged woman chain-smoking at a table crowded with a half-eaten carton of soggy fries, a pack of tarot cards, and a small TV.She seemed annoyed that I was interrupting the episode of \u201cOprah\u201d she was watching, but she motioned for me to sit down. After I handed her my money, she asked to see my palm. She looked at it for just a few seconds before warning me that the ghost of an ex-girlfriend was ruining my life. Her voice got lower and quieter as she emphasized how grave my situation was, but she perked up when she told me not to worry \u2014 because she could banish the ghost if I gave her another $150. Seeing as I was gay and had never been on date, much less had a girlfriend, I was unimpressed.Still, I wanted to believe. I wanted there to be something \u2015 someones! \u2015 waiting for us in the great waiting room in the sky. So, I continued to visit psychics throughout my 20s ... and I continued to be disappointed. No matter who I met or where I met them, no one ever gave me a reading that felt remotely genuine or accurate or personal. If the dead could talk, they had nothing to say to any of these so-called psychics \u2015 or me.Advertisement\n\nThen, when I was 28, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. He had never smoked, he walked several miles a day with his beloved Tibetan terrier, Harry, and he always took a handful of vitamins and supplements with breakfast. He loved his life, his family \u2015 especially my mom \u2015 and his job, and he wanted to live as long as he could so he could enjoy all of it for as long as he could.Cancer didn\u2019t care.Within five months, he was transformed from the sharpest, smartest, sweetest man I have ever known into a slobbering, writhing, moaning 80-pound zombie. Four weeks after he became the monster in our very own horror movie, he was dead. I was devastated.My mom, the toughest woman I have ever known (or will ever know), wasn\u2019t just devastated; she was destroyed. My parents had been together for over three decades and they had the kind of love you\u2019d swear was a sham \u2015 that it must have been engineered in some perky, permanently-Christmas-decorated laboratory deep within the offices of the Hallmark Channel \u2015 because there was no way it could be that pure or unwavering. But it was.With my dad gone, my mom had no idea how she was going to keep living and, honestly, had no real interest in it, but she clung to my brothers and me and somehow strung one day to the next until they piled up and began to almost resemble something like a life again. But none of us were fooled \u2015 least of all her \u2015 and we knew nothing would ever be the same.The author's dad with his Tibetan terrier, Harry.Courtesy of Noah MichelsonAdvertisement\n\nIronically, I didn\u2019t try to reach my dad after he died. Before his death, my obsession with mediums had been merely theoretical \u2015 a quaint hobby, a low-stakes leisure activity, a fun way to spend 50 bucks on a Saturday afternoon. Now, everything was different. He visited me in my dreams sometimes, and it was good to see him healthy again \u2015 almost glowing \u2015 in his old body, even if he didn\u2019t say much, but even that was almost more than I could take. Part of me was afraid of what would happen if I tried contacting him and he didn\u2019t show up. Would that mean he was truly gone? That there was nothing waiting for us out there? Or, maybe worse, that he didn\u2019t care enough to come back? Part of me was afraid of what would happen if I tried contacting him and he did show up. Would that mean he wasn\u2019t at peace? And what would he say? Would I want to hear it? Two and a half years after his death, I was working at a magazine and I was given the opportunity to interview a medium. This man had a reputation for knowing things that people just shouldn\u2019t know, and I was curious to find out if he might actually be able to do the things that so many others claimed they could but couldn\u2019t. We met at a restaurant in Manhattan that was supposedly haunted and filmed a fairly fluffy, lighthearted video about his unusual ability.The interview went well. The medium was kind and humble and seemed more like a middle school principal than someone who spent his days relaying messages from dead relatives. When we finished, we had lunch together at the restaurant, and after some friendly small talk, he asked me if I wanted a reading.I was caught off guard. Because I was there for business, not pleasure, and because I knew he charged hundreds of dollars and was booked years in advance, I didn\u2019t think he would offer me a reading. I told him that it wasn\u2019t necessary but he said it was no trouble \u2015 this was just what he did \u2015 and that he\u2019d be happy to show me how it worked. So, I agreed. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t wondering if my dad might show up, but I also didn\u2019t want to get my hopes up.Advertisement\n\nWhenever I visit a psychic, I always use the same protocol: I don\u2019t provide more information than I need to, I respond with nothing more than a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and I\u2019m always on the lookout for questions like, \u201cdo you know someone who passed with a name that begins with J or M?\u201d or \u201cdid someone die from some kind of disease in their chest?\u201d that are suspiciously vague and could apply to any number of people. I wanted this man to be different from the other mediums I had seen, but I wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for him.He began the reading by telling me there was a short, loudmouthed woman with red hair standing behind me and she was pointing to herself and saying \u201cEthel.\u201d\u201cEthel! Ethel! Ethel! She\u2019s practically yelling it. Is this your grandma?\u201d he asked.I froze.The author's grandparents. The family nicknamed his grandma \"Ethel\" because she looked so much like Ethel Merman.Courtesy of Noah MichelsonMy dad\u2019s mom was a short, loudmouthed redhead and she looked exactly like the actress Ethel Merman \u2015 so much so, that we used to call her that. Now, obviously, lots of grandmas are short and have big mouths and some have red hair and some are named Ethel, but the combination of the four together made me wonder if something unusual was unfolding. What\u2019s more, because her name wasn\u2019t actually Ethel \u2015 that was just a nickname my family gave her \u2015 this wasn\u2019t something that this man could have Googled. I told him that I understood what he was saying but didn\u2019t elaborate on exactly what part meant something to me. Still, just 30 seconds in, he officially had my attention.The next 10 minutes of the reading were a blur of people and events and comments like \u201cthere\u2019s someone here who owned a bakery in the \u201920s or \u201930s and they were known for their little pies.\u201d Since I don\u2019t know much about my extended family or my ancestors, most of it meant nothing to me, but I liked that he was giving me specific details, even if I couldn\u2019t confirm or deny any of them.Advertisement\n\nOther than the appearance of the woman who might have been my grandma, most of the reading felt like paging through a friend\u2019s photo album or attending a reunion for someone else\u2019s family. A lot of folks I didn\u2019t know were showing up to say hi, none of them had anything they really wanted to tell me, and, most disappointingly, there was no sign of my dad. Suddenly, the medium straightened up in his chair.\u201cOh. There\u2019s a man here with Ethel. I think it\u2019s her son. Does this mean anything to you?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d I responded, maybe too eagerly.\u201cDid your dad pass recently, Noah?\u201d he continued.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI think this is him and he has a message. Do you want to hear it?\u201d I inhaled sharply and held my breath longer than it wanted to be held.Could it really be my dad? Could the ghost of the guy who didn\u2019t believe in ghosts or God or heaven or hell or the existence of anything after death except falling into the deepest, darkest, soundest sleep really have whooshed off whatever cloud he\u2019d been sunbathing on and into this little cafe to slip me some secret he hadn\u2019t managed to share while he was still alive? And, if so, what could it be?\u201cYes, I want to hear it,\u201d I told him.The author's parents sometime in the early '70s, not long after they were marriedCourtesy of Noah Michelson\u201cOK. He\u2019s saying this very clearly \u2015 I can hear him very clearly \u2015 \u2018Tell Ruth I love her.\u2019\u201dMy entire body went numb. My mom\u2019s middle name was Ruth and even though no one called her that, for as long as my parents had been together, my dad had only ever referred to her as Ruthie. It was stunning, but not at all surprising. If my father were given one more chance to say anything to anyone, this would be it. \u201cOh, there\u2019s something else. He wants you to tell Ruth that she can get rid of his ties now. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s time to let them go.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I was shocked. My dad had been an attorney and he had an incredible collection of neckties. Whenever he\u2019d go on vacation, he\u2019d buy a tie from whatever country he visited and, aside from his watches, which he\u2019d given to my brothers and me just weeks before he died, they were his prize possessions. I also knew that though my dad had died years earlier, my mom still hadn\u2019t been able to get rid of his things.My brothers and I didn\u2019t push her to, either. We figured there was no harm in our dad\u2019s closet staying full until whenever she was ready \u2015 even if that took another 10 or 20 or 50 years. But here was my dad, my mom\u2019s greatest champion and biggest fan, raising whatever phantom energy he could muster to try to nudge her to something closer to closure. Everything I\u2019d just been told made complete sense \u2015 and it made no sense at all.The reading ended shortly after that, and I thanked the medium. On my way back to my office, my body thrummed with the energy and peculiarity of what had just happened. I felt like I\u2019d eaten three Thanksgiving dinners and then rode a rollercoaster on repeat for a week. My stomach was flip-flopping, my head was pounding and my heart felt 16 times too big for my chest.But what, exactly, had just happened? How could this man have known those things? Could he have Googled me and found my dad\u2019s obituary? My mom\u2019s middle name? A photo of my grandma? But what about \u201cEthel?\u201d And how could he have known about the ties still hanging in my dad\u2019s closet? Did he just guess that, like many lawyers, he had a lot of them and, like many widows, my mom still hadn\u2019t given them away? I wanted to believe, but I couldn\u2019t shake my skepticism. I\u2019d had too many experiences with too many fakes. Still, I understood why so many people spend so much money on mediums \u2015 often, more money than they should or have to spend. The chance, however slim, to hear from my dad was just too enticing to turn down, and making contact with him, however improbable, had been intoxicating.Advertisement\n\nI called my mom. I wasn\u2019t sure she would believe what I had to tell her, but I wanted her to hear it.\u201cMom, I just finished interviewing that medium and he claims that Dad showed up,\u201d I told her.\u201cWhat!\u201d she responded with a mix of incredulity and excitement.\u201cAnd he had a message. He said, \u2018Tell Ruth I love her.\u2019\u201dI could hear her begin to cry.\u201cThat\u2019s not all \u2015 I know you haven\u2019t gotten rid of dad\u2019s stuff yet...\u201d\u201cWell...\u201d she said through her tears.\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you this, but I finally took it all to Goodwill a few weeks ago,\u201d she said.\u201cOh ... that\u2019s so weird. Because \u2018Dad\u2019 wanted me to tell you that can get rid of his ties. He said it\u2019s time to let them go.\u201dMy mom began to sob. When she could finally catch her breath, she said, \u201cNoah ... the only thing I didn\u2019t get rid of were his ties. They\u2019re still in the closet. I just couldn\u2019t...\u201dNow we were both crying.The author's mom surprised him and his brothers with quilts made out of their dad's tie collection.Courtesy of Noah MichelsonEven if the medium had guessed that my dad had a tie collection and even if he had guessed that my mom had held on to them for two and a half years after his death, there was no way he could have known that those were the only things she had kept. Only my mom had known that. It was just too much.Advertisement\n\nI\u2019ve seen more mediums since that experience, but my dad has never come through again. If it was really him that day, maybe he said exactly what he needed to say and then thought, I trust you all to take the things I taught you when I was with you and keep going. You\u2019ve got this! I\u2019m going back to sleeping or eating all the angel food cake my ghost belly can take or doing whatever else my ghost heart desires, and I\u2019ll see you soon enough. Maybe he\u2019s been reincarnated as a rhino or a potato or a brand-new human doing the same old human things somewhere on the other side of the planet. Maybe it wasn\u2019t him and I got tricked. Maybe when he died, he died, and he\u2019s dead and that\u2019s just the way it goes. I don\u2019t know.But here\u2019s what I do know.I know my mom believes my dad is out there somewhere looking out for her and rooting her on and waiting for her to join him, and I love that my experience meant something to her and solidified something for her and maybe makes every day without him a little less miserable. I know that even if the message wasn\u2019t real, what that medium said was real, and I will always welcome any reminder of my father\u2019s otherworldly love \u2015 and how it shaped who I am \u2015 whenever and however I can get it. Call me sentimental. Call me stupid. I can take it.I know that we don\u2019t talk about death enough, and because we don\u2019t, those of us left behind can feel especially lonely and incredibly alone. I know that grief isn\u2019t straightforward or predictable and, while time may help loosen its grip on us, it can linger for years \u2015 forever \u2015 and sneak up on us when we least expect it. I know that the further I get from my dad\u2019s death, the harder it is to keep him here with me, to hear his voice, and the harder I have to \u2015 and want to \u2015 work to tether him to my life.Because of that, even if I still don\u2019t know if I believe in ghosts (though I really want to!), I know I believe in ghost stories. I know I believe in the power of words \u2014 of calling to those who have left this world and finding whatever other parts of them we can find wherever we can find them.Advertisement\n\nI know I believe in memories and the weight and beauty they carry, and what they are capable of when we silently conjure them before we fall asleep or speak them out loud and share them with each other. I know I believe that remembering is how we pull our pasts into the present, and I believe in the potential remembering has to create and form and transform our futures.I don\u2019t know if my dad was with me that day, but I know that if my dad were to take the trouble to return here on that day or ever again, he would come back exactly as he supposedly did for nothing less than love, and that each incandescent word he sent to bloom in the mouth of whatever medium is lucky enough to greet his spirit for however long we\u2019re lucky enough to have him here on this plane again would be nothing short of magic, and \u2015 real or imaginary, true or false, ghost or grift \u2015 that\u2019s a gift.Noah Michelson is the Head of HuffPost Personal and the host of \u201cD Is For Desire,\u201d HuffPost\u2019s love and sex podcast.

I had left the warm restroom to try to squeeze into my wetsuit outside. Inside were two 40-ish friends trying to force their bodies into some unforgiving wetsuits of their own. One of the women had ended up on the floor, giggling nonstop as her friend tried to pull the suit onto her body. She kept muttering: \u201cThis can\u2019t be right. This can\u2019t be right!\u201dAdvertisement\n\nShe had a Russian accent and was model-beautiful, with curves. I had stood in the corner watching this transpire and felt out of place. It took me back to my days on a college cross-country team when women would strip down in the locker rooms, comfortable in their own skin, while I would change in a bathroom stall. I was awkward, flat-chested and convinced my body was ugly. And that is how I found myself outside on that 50-degree morning, where I suction-cupped myself into my thick black suit with the assistance of my husband.I had the usual pit in my stomach, the one I get when I leave my comfort zone. The water looked gray and frigid, the sky was about to spit rain and the time was 6:45 a.m.When we moved to Florida two years earlier, I added snorkeling with manatees to my bucket list. My birthday seemed like the perfect excuse to ditch my kids and head three hours north on a three-hour snorkeling adventure. Advertisement\n\nI had turned 32 a week earlier and was beginning to understand why people dread their birthdays. Sure, I continued to enjoy the part with cake and ice cream, but I had sprouted a large crop of gray hairs over the past year, and my body was no longer the one I had in high school.It now included stretch marks thanks to my love for brownies, popping out two kids, and the passage of time. The pounds I had gained settled on my stomach, and I sometimes found myself squishing my belly together and poking at it while an uncontrollable voice in my head repeated, \u201cYou are disgusting.\u201d I knew this voice couldn\u2019t be trusted, but the longer I heard it, the easier it was to believe. We rode a boat down the river and listened to our captain\u2019s instructions. When it came time to jump in the water, the pit in my stomach deepened. \u201cThis seems like a bad idea,\u201d my brain whispered. My wet feet trudged across the boat to head to the stern. I ignored the voice, backed down the ladder and plopped into the water.\u201cFloat on your stomach!\u201d our guide shouted. But the buoyancy of the wetsuit threw me off balance. I splashed around, eventually gaining enough mobility to roll over, and plunged my face into the river.Advertisement\n\nThe water was clear but dark in the early morning light. Seagrass covered the riverbed, but no manatees were in sight. Our guide herded us up, and we started swimming toward a cove. It was there that we first saw them.About 30 manatees were sleeping in a group among the grass. Every few minutes, they would rise to the surface for a breath and float back down to the bottom. One made eye contact with me.\u201cOh my gosh, this manatee and I have a connection. We are communicating through our eyes,\u201d I thought.\u201cHello, cute manatee,\u201d I said with my gaze, fully present in this almost spiritual moment. I waited for his eyes to tell me something. He floated back down to the bottom, apparently asleep the entire time.Manatees are simultaneously adorable and ugly. I know this sounds like a contradiction, but it is not. They are the same shape as lumpy sweet potatoes, with small, black eyes. They have coarse hairs that dot their body, similar to the ones I pluck off my chin as soon as they appear. They average 1,000 pounds. And did you know they have toenails? Yet despite all of these things, they are somehow cute.Advertisement\n\nOver the next couple of hours, all my ruminations \u2014 about my weight and my aging body \u2014 disappeared. When I submerged my face in the frigid water, I entered a world where that self-critical voice did not exist. I spent three hours in awe watching these huge creatures sleep, eat and play. The manatees could not care less about what I looked like, and frankly we all looked equally weird in our snorkeling gear and wetsuits. Misty Van FoekenOur group moved to a spot in the river where the animals were awake and playful. A baby manatee barreled into me, sucking on my wetsuit strap. In an instant, a group of curious manatees surrounded me. We love these animals because of who they are, with their docile, curious, roly-poly personalities. They are lovable because they are gentle, vulnerable. Despite very few defense mechanisms, manatees explore the world around them in wonder. They explore despite scars on their backs and faces from boat motors. We love them, imperfections and all. Advertisement\n\nHere I was, judging myself based on some belly fat and a few stretch marks. But maybe my worth comes from existing as who I am \u2014 a great amalgam of imperfections that add up to make one beautiful creature. When I climbed back into the boat, a sense of peace saturated my being. For a blissful two hours, I had escaped the critical voice in my head. Not only that, but I came away with a changed perspective. I\u2019m not going to sell this as a miracle cure. Swimming with manatees didn\u2019t erase the self-critical voice in my head, nor did it hypnotize me into loving my stomach. But it taught me to question the voice. And when the critical voice becomes too loud, I head out on a quest for wonder. Most of the time, it is not as grand as snorkeling with manatees. Sometimes, I go to my garden to watch as monarch caterpillars slowly transform into butterflies. Other times, I go for a hike. Once I stumbled upon lizards having sex. That completely shut the voice up.When I get out of my head long enough to lace up my hiking boots or squirm into a wetsuit, I am reminded that the world is vast, wild and beautiful. And whether I am on a flower-lined trail, in the salty ocean, or wrapped up in the tiny details of my yard, I am just thankful to my body for getting me there.

The walls of our kitchen seemed far too tight \u2015 the air thick and hard to breathe.At first, we didn\u2019t say anything. We just gripped each other\u2019s hands like we were clinging to life. On the street corner, Kai stumbled a bit, grabbed onto our neighbor\u2019s stone retaining wall. He looked at the November sky, the nearly bare trees, the dog. Advertisement\n\nThen he looked at me.\u201cWill I make it to 60?\u201d he asked.The cogs in my mind whirled and clicked. I counted in my head, mentally tore pages from the calendar. December, January, February... June. Less than seven months away. I reached and grabbed his shoulders until he looked me in the eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you to 60.\u201dHow logical, commanding and certain I sounded. Strong. In charge.After months of antibiotics for a sinus infection Kai didn\u2019t have, weeks of headaches and more coughing and low-grade fevers, a referral to an ENT specialist and prescribed irrelevant treatments, the doctor sent him for a last-ditch X-ray. They found the mass in his lung. By the time it was discovered, the tumor was already 14 centimeters. And it had metastasized. Kai was a stage IV dead man walking. Unlike cancers such as prostate and breast cancer, for which the survival rates have steadily increased over the last half a century due to simple factors such as awareness and routine screenings, lung cancer survival rates are low. The diagnosis nearly always comes too late to do anything but start therapies like chemo and radiation \u2015 things that treat but can\u2019t cure. Advertisement\n\nKai was, for a 59-year-old man, incredibly healthy. He ate all the right things (I know because I was the cook in the family), exercised every day, saw doctors regularly. A former football cornerback, he had no known risk factors and no warning signs. In fact, he\u2019d passed a full battery of physicals and X-rays and blood tests in preparation for an elective knee replacement surgery only a year prior. But cancer found him anyway. The tumor went from nothing to enormous, growing an average of 1.16 centimeters per month.\u201cHow long?\u201d we asked the doctor.We were determined not to use the internet for medical information. We promised each other. I mostly kept the promise. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019d cave, Google a quick answer only to catch a phrase, choke on my breath, jerk away, close out the offending webpage that read \u201cthe two-year survival rate is about ten percent; the five-year about zero.\u201d\u201cThe average is 18 months,\u201d Kai\u2019s doctor told us. He quickly followed with, \u201cBut that takes into account all patients, most of whom are much older and sicker, far less healthy than you are, with multiple risk factors. We have every reason to believe you will far exceed the average.\u201dHe added, \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the kind of life you want to live \u2015 what you want to do with your time.\u201d\u201cThe tumor went from nothing to enormous, growing an average of 1.16 centimeters per month.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nOn Sept.12, the 60th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMoonshot\u201d address to the nation, President Joe Biden announced plans for \u201canother moonshot: ending cancer as we know it.\u201dLike most of us, Biden is no stranger to the impotent pain of having a loved one suffer from the disease. His son, Beau, died from cancer in 2015 at the age of 46. The fact of the disease is bad enough, but the complete inability to do anything at all is a feeling of helplessness and loneliness like no other.The president launched the Cancer Cabinet in February 2022, and in July, its priorities were to, among other goals, improve cancer screening, decrease cancer\u2019s impact, and support both patients and caregivers. Specifically, Biden\u2019s moonshot prioritizes biotechnology research and creates a new governmental agency dedicated to \u201cbiomedical innovation that supports the health of all Americans.\u201d More than 100 main types of cancer exist. Lung cancer comes in two flavors. Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for about 90% of all lung cancers and itself comes in three kinds. Kai, with his squamous cell carcinoma, was one of the more than 2 million people worldwide \u2014 about the population of Chicago, home to his beloved Cubs \u2014 served that diagnosis in 2017 alone, and in the disease\u2019s advanced stages, it was too late to send it back to the kitchen: \u201cNo, thank you. This is not what I ordered.\u201d Advertisement\n\nThe two treatment options for him were equally repulsive and ordered together: chemotherapy\u2019s chemicals through the bloodstream and radiation\u2019s X-rays to a localized area. Neither therapy distinguishes between healthy and cancerous cells; each kills both.But the doctor told us that, because of Kai\u2019s overall health, he was a candidate for a cutting-edge treatment: immunotherapy. By 2017, it had shown great promise in clinical trials. A moonshot of sorts, albeit on an individual scale.Designed to attack invaders while protecting citizen cells, the human immune system learns a new language through this treatment. Instead of targeting the cancer directly, immunotherapy overhauls the body\u2019s communication network to activate all defenses toward the destruction of the cancerous, once-normal, cells.It would not cure him \u2014 a cure was not possible \u2014 but immunotherapy could lead to long-lasting remission and increased survival time.The out-of-pocket cost, the doctor told us, was about $500, a minuscule price to pay for something that might give more time. Advertisement\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d we said, \u201cabsolutely yes.\u201d\u201cHow much life is enough, when we can\u2019t have forever? I guess the answer is, like any toddler would tell you, more.\u201dIsn\u2019t this what we all want \u2014 both for ourselves and for the people we love? More time? Such a human desire to continue life at any cost. To spare no expense and no treatment, to prolong the inevitable for us all.The doctor ordered a battery of genetic tests for markers to determine appropriateness.The bill we later received turned out to be closer to 100 times the cost we had been quoted. And it made no difference. Kai\u2019s profile was not a match. And despite the prognosis \u2014 enough time still to live \u2014 he died just five months after his diagnosis. Five weeks before his 60th birthday. He was supposed to have made it longer. I said so. The doctor said so. Even the internet said so. But how much life is enough, when we can\u2019t have forever?I guess the answer is, like any toddler would tell you, more. Whatever we get, more is what we want. This goal is always the moonshot, no matter how ambitious and unlikely to succeed. We feel we have to try, down to the last possible Hail Mary pass. Giving up is the only real failure. Advertisement\n\nAnd we did try, with everything modern medicine could offer. Kai\u2019s medical team took a moonshot with his weekly chemo and daily radiation, more treatment than most cancer patients can bear. Kai was so strong he never even looked sick, never stopped eating and never lost his hair. Right up to the very end, Kai was recognizably himself: handsome, strong, loving and wickedly funny.Five years later, I still have so much to learn about who I am as a widow \u2015 not a wife. It\u2019s too late for Kai, and for Beau, and for the other 1 in every 6 people on earth who have already died from cancer \u2014 each of them a parent, sibling, child, partner, friend. All of them loved. But I hope with all my heart that Biden\u2019s moonshot finds its mark. If some cancers might eventually be cured and other cancers can join the \u201cvaccine available\u201d ranks of illnesses like COVID and chicken pox and the flu, maybe we can break some of grief\u2019s stranglehold over us, at least long enough to fully live the lives we wanted.Helene Kiser is the author of \u201cTopography.\u201d Her work has appeared in dozens of literary magazines and anthologies and has been nominated twice for the Pushcart Prize.

Republicans have held firm majorities in the state Senate since 1984 and the state House of Representatives since 2011. In the last round of redistricting, the GOP gerrymandered the body to the point that it was essentially impossible for them to lose.But everything has changed ahead of this year\u2019s midterm contests. In 2018, Michigan voters put an independent redistricting commission in charge of drawing new district maps. Last year, the commission approved maps that were significantly more competitive than their predecessors, a change that has fueled Democratic hopes that the state Senate majority \u2014 and potentially control of the state House too \u2014 is finally up for grabs in 2022.Advertisement\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a very long time, I feel like we\u2019re playing on an even playing field,\u201d Hertel told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing a rigged game for three decades here in Michigan, and finally for the first time, it\u2019s not rigged. We have maps that are even.\u201dDemocrats have routinely been hammered at the state legislative level over the last decade: Between 2010 and 2018, the party lost hundreds of state legislative seats nationwide, and successful Republican gerrymandering schemes have rendered many majorities almost totally out of reach. In 2020, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, a party political arm, poured record sums of money into such races, but failed to flip a single state legislative chamber.The independent redistricting commission, though, has suddenly provided Democrats a path forward in Michigan, turning it into the biggest state legislative battleground of the 2022 cycle.\u201cWe see Michigan as a huge opportunity because of the newly drawn fair maps,\u201d said Jessica Post, the DLCC\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s at the top of our flip list.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of an independent redistricting commission has fueled Democratic hopes that issues like abortion access and voting rights could help them retake control of the Michigan state legislature, which Republican gerrymandering practices had long put out of reach.JEFF KOWALSKY via Getty ImagesRepublicans currently hold a 22-16 majority in the Michigan state Senate, and a 56-53 grip on the state House, where one seat is held by an independent. But other developments have bolstered Michigan Democrats\u2019 beliefs that they can flip one or both chambers: The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, has seemingly upended a midterm landscape that seemed heavily tilted toward the GOP.Michiganders will vote on an abortion rights referendum in November, after the state Supreme Court ruled against the Republican legislative majority\u2019s efforts to block it from appearing on the ballot. The issue is driving Democratic campaigns from the top of the ticket, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has made protecting abortion rights a central focus of her reelection message, to the bottom: In May, just days after the draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe leaked, Democrat Carol Glanville upset a GOP opponent in a special state legislative election. The victory may have portended a larger shift: Michigan is among the states that have seen a surge in women voter registrations since the Roe decision, according to Democratic strategist Tom Bonier. Advertisement\n\nThe abortion fight is a lens, Democrats and progressives say, into how the gerrymandered legislature protected GOP majorities even when they were out of step with public sentiment. Polls show that a majority of Michiganders support legal access to abortion; in an election that may be defined by that issue more than any other, the fairer maps mean that the composition of the state legislature \u2014 and the Senate in particular \u2014 will likely reflect the majority of votes cast in such races across the state.\u201cInstead of a state legislative majority focused on banning life-saving health care or looking the other way while poisonous water flowed from families\u2019 taps, with fairer districts for the first time in decades, there could be a majority in the legislature that represents the views of Michiganders \u2014 not right-wing extremism,\u201d said Simone Leiro, a spokesperson for the States Project, a progressive organization that focuses on state legislatures and has also made Michigan a priority in 2022.Despite Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm for it, the independent redistricting commission did not result from an effort to boost them in particular. It instead grew out of a Facebook group of voters who were frustrated with a legislature that over the last decade had morphed into one of the most heavily gerrymandered bodies in the nation. In 2014, as the nonprofit news outlet Bridge Michigan noted, Michigan Republicans won 27 of 38 state Senate races even though the overall vote count was almost evenly split between the parties. Two years later, Michigan Democrats narrowly won a slight majority of votes cast across all state House races. But at the end of election night, Republicans controlled 63 of 110 seats.\u201cNo voter in Michigan, regardless of party, thought that politics and politicians were working for them. It was an issue, gerrymandering, that brought voters together across the political spectrum.\u201d- Nancy Wang, Voters Not PoliticiansAdvertisement\n\nBy 2017, Voters Not Politicians, a grassroots organization that sprung out of the original Facebook discussions, had collected 425,000 signatures on a petition calling for the adoption of an independent redistricting commission. The campaign took advantage of a quirk in Michigan law that allows citizen petition drives to propose constitutional amendments directly to voters if they obtain the requisite number of signatures. Rampant gerrymandering practices, the group argued to voters, had created a litany of districts in which lawmakers were insulated from real threats to their seat, unless it came from a member of their own party. It created a legislature that was unresponsive to voters and their needs, and helped the GOP govern without much fear of blowback.\u201cRegardless of party affiliation, it was very clear that our politicians were not working for voters,\u201d said Nancy Wang, a law professor at the University of Michigan who in 2017 co-founded Voters Not Politicians, a grassroots group that led the push for an independent redistricting commission. \u201cThey were using their political power to to serve special interests, and to keep themselves in power.\u201dThat November, 61% of Michiganders voted to approve the creation of a 13-person redistricting commission that would feature four Democrats, four Republicans, and five nonpartisan commissioners. \u201cNo voter in Michigan, regardless of party, thought that politics and politicians were working for them,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt was an issue, gerrymandering, that brought voters together across the political spectrum.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nThe new maps are significantly more competitive, as differing analyses of them makes clear. The commission itself used data that showed they would still slightly advantage Republicans. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, though, sees both the state Senate and state House maps as slightly favorable to Democrats.\u201cIn the past, we would identify a handful \u2014 maybe half a dozen \u2014 frontline seats that were winnable,\u201d said state Rep. Rachel Hood (D), whose Grand Rapids district became more competitive. \u201cNow, with this sort of flood of more moderate seats, we have arguably between 15 and 25 seats in play, with 5-point plus or minus margins.\u201dThat has already changed Michigan politically, regardless of who ultimately controls the state legislature after November\u2019s elections, Wang argued.\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you unrig your elections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see a lot of candidates have to fight for votes, they have to persuade voters to vote for them. And there are a lot more competitive districts.\u201dThe independent redistricting process was not free of controversy or criticism, even from Democrats who are happy with the overall outcome.Advertisement\n\nThe new maps reduced the number of majority-minority districts in the state legislature from 15 \u2014 10 in the state House and five in the state Senate \u2014 to just five, according to Bridge Michigan. There\u2019s not a single Black-majority district in the state Senate. The changes will hit metro Detroit particularly hard: The new maps carved up the state\u2019s most populous city in a way that could make it much harder for Black candidates to win legislative seats.Before the maps were finalized, Black lawmakers and voting rights groups accused the commission of misinterpreting data and called for it to redraw new districts. The commission\u2019s maps \u201cdiminish the voice & representation of Black people and our issues,\u201d state Sen. Marshall Bullock, a Democratic member of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, said in a statement last December. \u201cIt is unacceptable and must be addressed and corrected immediately.\u201dA coalition of lawmakers and outside groups ultimately sued this year, alleging that the maps violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The commission defended the maps and argued that they were in compliance with federal law. The Michigan Supreme Court dismissed the suit in February.Democrats in Michigan and nationally are still broadly upset about the state House maps, a caveat nearly all of them append to otherwise enthusiastic praise for the commission\u2019s work.Post, of the DLCC, also cautioned that independent redistricting commissions are not necessarily a blanket solution to gerrymandering. Democrats have raised issues with the independent redistricting process in Arizona, and the concerns about Black and minority representation in Michigan are evidence, she said, that the independent commissions do not automatically guarantee totally fair representation.Advertisement\n\nWith the new maps in effect, Voters Not Politicians has continued to spread the word about independent redistricting, encouraging voters to turn out for the first elections held under them.\u201cIt\u2019s a new world here in Michigan, because we took the power to gerrymander away from politicians and now that power is in the hands of voters,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThis is going to be our first election under fair maps, where voters\u2019 votes will determine who is elected. And we feel that energy on the ground.\u201dDemocrats are hopeful that energy will pay dividends for the party\u2019s candidates, who have homed in on the issues where the GOP\u2019s deadlock on the legislature has allowed it to race Michigan to the right: A Democratic majority, they\u2019ve argued, could seek to protect abortion access, implement new gun control measures, roll back Michigan\u2019s anti-union \u201cright-to-work\u201d law and expand voting rights.\u201cWhat we want to do is what Michiganders want,\u201d Hertel said. \u201cThese are all policies that have been protected by a gerrymandered majority. They are majority opinions that have been stuck because of a gerrymandered legislature. And I think this is the year we change that. Roe is on the ballot. Democracy itself is on the ballot. The rights of our friends and neighbors are on the ballot.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean Democrats are assured control of the state Senate or state House in November. But at least now, he argued, they have a chance.Advertisement\n\n\u201cUnder the old maps, we could get everything right and still lose,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder these maps, I strongly believe that the opportunity is there, and we\u2019re in a fair fight.\u201dRelated...Democrats Launch Massive Negative Ad Campaign Against GOP On AbortionAn Abortion Rights Amendment For Michigan Is Back On The November BallotMichigan Court Says 1931 Abortion Ban Is Unconstitutional", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michigan-gerrymandering-state-legislature-independent-redistricting-commission_n_63287ddee4b082746bec6496", "title": "How Michigan Became The Biggest State Legislative Battleground Of 2022"}, {"authors": "Lydia O'Connor", "date_publish": "2022-09-19T20:40:26-0400", "description": "A Texas law enforcement agency said Monday that it has opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Florida Gov", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "A Texas law enforcement agency said Monday that it has opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Florida Gov.

AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.HELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 A Montana judge issued a scathing ruling Monday saying state health officials made \u201ccalculated violations\u201d of his order to temporarily stop enforcing a law to prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate unless they had undergone surgery.District Judge Michael Moses said he would promptly consider motions for contempt based on continued violations of his April order, which he clarified in a verbal order at a hearing on Thursday. Just hours after that hearing, the Republican-run state said it would defy the order.During Thursday\u2019s hearing, attorneys for the state argued that blocking the law did not prevent the health department from promulgating new administrative rules.Advertisement\n\nMontana District Judge Michael Moses speaks to attorneys during a court hearing on birth certificate changes for transgender people, on Sept 15, 2022, in Billings, Mont. Moses said in a Monday, Sept. 19, 2022, order that state health officials were being \"demonstrably ridiculous\" as they repeatedly refused to follow his orders to stop enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate.via Associated PressThe state, Moses wrote, engaged \u201cin needless legal gymnastics to attempt to rationalize their actions and their calculated violations of the order.\u201d He called the state\u2019s interpretation of his earlier order \u201cdemonstrably ridiculous.\u201dThe state Department of Public Health and Human Services and the Attorney General\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.\u201cAll that\u2019s left is for the department to comply with the order and if they don\u2019t, the consequences are clear,\u201d said Alex Rate, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, which is representing the two transgender plaintiffs who want to change the gender marker on their birth certificates.In April, Moses temporarily blocked a law passed by the Republican-controlled 2021 Legislature that would require transgender residents to undergo a surgical procedure and obtain a court order before being able to change the sex on their birth certificate. He said the law, which did not specify what kind of surgery would be required, was unconstitutionally vague.Advertisement\n\nRather than returning to a 2017 rule that allowed transgender residents to file an affidavit with the health department to correct the gender on their birth certificate, the state instead issued a rule saying a person\u2019s gender could not be changed at all, unless there was a clerical error.The health department \u201crefused to issue corrections to birth certificates for weeks in violation of the order,\u201d Moses wrote.The ACLU of Montana had requested the judicial clarification due to the state\u2019s inaction.Moses\u2019 order on Monday included a copy of the 2017 rules.\u201cIf defendants requires further clarification, they are welcome to request it from the court rather than engage in activities that constitute unlawful violations of the order,\u201d Moses wrote.Such open defiance of a judge\u2019s order is very unusual from a government agency, said Carl Tobias, a former University of Montana Law School professor now at the University of Richmond. When officials disagree with a ruling, the typical response is to appeal to a higher court, he said.\u201cAppeal is what you contemplate \u2014 not that you can nullify a judge\u2019s orders. Otherwise, people just wouldn\u2019t obey the law,\u201d Tobias said Thursday. \u201cThe system can\u2019t work that way.\u201d\u2032Advertisement\n\nThe legal dispute comes as conservative lawmakers in numerous states including Montana have sought to restrict transgender rights, including banning transgender girls from competing in girls school sports. A different Montana judge last week determined a law passed by state lawmakers seeking to ban transgender women from participating on female collegiate sports teams was unconstitutional.___Associated Press reporter Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this story.Related...Montana Judge Blocks Anti-trans Birth Certificate Rule, Chides State AttorneysMontana Adopts Rule Barring Trans People From Changing Sex On Birth CertificateMy Abortion Wasn't Agonizing Or Traumatic.

It follows the reboot of a fictional early 2000s family sitcom, \u201cStep Right Up,\u201d and the tensions it places on its dysfunctional cast and crew.Among the stars of the show (and show within a show) are Keegan-Michael Key, Judy Greer and Johnny Knoxville, whose characters begrudgingly sign on for the reboot after many disappointing career and life changes since the original run. Paul Reiser \u2014 who was recently in a reboot of his own, with the 2019 revival of 1990s sitcom \u201cMad About You\u201d \u2014 and Rachel Bloom play Gordon and Hannah, the father-daughter team of showrunners behind the relaunch of \u201cStep Right Up.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nPremiering Tuesday, the eight-episode series marks creator Steven Levitan\u2019s first show since the long-running ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family.\u201d HuffPost Senior Culture Reporters Marina Fang and Candice Frederick discuss what they thought of \u201cReboot\u201d and assess where it fits into the larger cultural conversation on the topic.Marina Fang: All of us on the HuffPost culture desk talk a lot about the seemingly never-ending stream of reboots, revivals, re-imaginings, etc., etc. \u2014 what I often like to joke is the \u201creboot industrial complex.\u201d So the idea of a sitcom about a fictional reboot of a sitcom, involving a lot of people who\u2019ve been part of major sitcoms before, definitely piqued my interest. Candice, what did you think of \u201cReboot,\u201d and how well do you think it captures this cultural moment we\u2019re in?Candice Frederick: Yeah, the reboot industrial complex is real, and it\u2019s exhausting. So, I went into \u201cReboot\u201d fearing it would be a bit navel-gazey and unnecessary.But I was struck by how much it delves into what it means to actually go forward with a reboot, the human impact of it. Like, how the actors, who haven\u2019t worked in forever \u2014 or who haven\u2019t gotten the type of prestige work they thought would follow after the series \u2014 are ill-equipped to deal with the new celebrity industrial complex where media can be very vampiric with their personal questions, or what it means to bring a show from a certain period into present day.Advertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s to become of the original staff writers? Can they write dialogue that pertains or contends with today\u2019s culture? What does that look like when they have to share a writing room with younger writers?

But I think it finds the right balance in its meta jokes about the industry. For example, the show within a show, like the show itself, is being produced at Hulu, and one of the characters is a fictionalized Hulu executive. That was all very funny.Once I started watching it, I found myself wishing it had a sharper point of view about the concept of reboots \u2014 a specific thing it was trying to say about it all. But then, when you and I were deciding to do this \u201cShould You Watch It?\u201d article, you mentioned everything you said above. And I realized you\u2019re totally right, that this is what really makes this show interesting.In the larger cultural discussion around reboots, we don\u2019t talk as much about what it means for the actors and writers to return to something they made 20 years ago, that probably hasn\u2019t aged well, and how they\u2019re probably in a very different place in their lives and careers when they decide to do these reboots. This show does a great job of exploring those dynamics.Advertisement\n\nStandout PerformancesMF: The dynamic between Bree and Reed (Greer and Key) felt totally lived-in. Like, I totally bought that they had a thing 20 years ago, and being together again is bringing up all kinds of messy feelings. I loved both of those performances, part of a really stacked cast on this show.Candice, what did you think of the cast, and were there any really standout performances for you?CF: OMG yes! Loved that the comedy exec at Hulu (Krista Marie Yu) is hyperserious and actually knows nothing about comedy. I\u2019m sure this happens a lot in the industry.Krista Marie Yu as Elaine, a fictionalized Hulu executive in charge of the \"Step Right Up\" reboot.Michael Desmond/HuluTo your point, though, it did stick out to me that the show doesn\u2019t have a point of view about reboots \u2014 especially since you and I both definitely do! But I also wonder if these folks who decide to do a reboot actually have a point of view on that. Some need the money. Others need their careers reinvigorated. Others, especially women like Judy Greer\u2019s character, need to prove that they still have it and that the industry can\u2019t send them out to pasture just yet. That was all very interesting to me.LOL, Judy and Keegan are comedy gold, totally agree. You know who I also thought was quite interesting? Alyah Chanelle Scott, who plays Timberly, who\u2019s kind of a plant from the reality TV show industrial complex. She parlayed that into a scripted TV career. But when she tries to prove herself, of course people like Bree feel threatened. That was a totally unexpected storyline that actually made a lot of sense to me, and I think both women are very good there.Advertisement\n\nWhat did you think of Johnny Knoxville and his character (who I admit I have never actually seen on anything before)? I intentionally avoided the whole \u201cJackass\u201d phenomenon.Knoxville as Clay and Key as Reed on the set of \"Step Right Up.\"Michael Desmond/HuluMF: Yes, I liked how that all felt very real!I also have never watched any of the installments of the \u201cJackass\u201d franchise. I did like that his character seemed pretty reflective of a washed-up, middle-aged white dude \u2014 like, you can easily picture a real-life equivalent.CF: Same! He is definitely a major source of comic relief but actually has gravitas. Like a whole lot of these characters, he\u2019s been sort of just ... floating since this TV show. So, we get to see him really wrangle with that as well.So, there\u2019s a whole other section of the show that could have possibly been its own series, which is the relationship between Rachel Bloom\u2019s and Paul Reiser\u2019s characters, Hannah and Gordon. As a stand-alone character, I think Gordon is actually more interesting as the returning showrunner who\u2019s trying to navigate the new turf and having to partner with his daughter, Hannah. Hannah is the more unsure character, who\u2019s still getting her feet wet. But we again see how these two generations can work together. Advertisement\n\nGordon (Paul Reiser) and Hannah (Rachel Bloom), the father-daughter team of showrunners on \"Step Right Up.\"HuluMF: Yeah, I liked seeing the writers room, which is another place where the show could have gotten a bit too navel-gazey, but it really works. Gordon is used to doing things the old way: hiring all of his friends, writing a bunch of hacky, tired jokes, etc. Meanwhile, Hannah is trying to make a more substantive show and hire a more inclusive writers room. The way they are constantly at an impasse feels like a lot of what we see play out in real life.Were there any other high points for you, or anything else you wanted to shout out? I think it\u2019s safe to say we both liked it.CF: Yes! The genuineness of their reactions really worked. Like, that is exactly how I would imagine it would be.Should \u201cReboot\u201d Get Another Season?CF: I think one question that came to mind is whether this deserves another season. Like, do we want more of this story? Honestly, I\u2019d watch. I think there is more story to mine here.Advertisement\n\nMF: That\u2019s a good question! Like a lot of streaming series, these eight episodes tell a complete story but also leave just enough of an opening for another season. I could go either way. If they do pick it up for a second season, I\u2019d watch it.CF: Same! I\u2019d like to know more about these people. Somewhat related: Did you ever watch the show \u201cUnreal\u201d? I think this would make a good companion piece because of what they both say about the human impact of putting on what are ultimately scripted TV shows.MF: Yes, I did watch and really liked \u201cUnreal,\u201d until it went off the rails in its later seasons. There was also a short-lived Fox show last year called \u201cThe Big Leap,\u201d which is similar to \u201cUnreal\u201d but the show within a show is a dance competition series \u2014 another possibility, if you\u2019re reading this and want to check out more of these shows with meta qualities about TV. Can we call them \u201cRussian doll shows\u201d? LOL.CF: Haha I love that \u2014 and now I have to find \u201cThe Big Leap\u201d! Never even heard of it.So, Should You Watch It?MF: Anyway, should you watch \u201cReboot\u201d? Definitely.CF: And yes, I really like \u201cReboot\u201d! Would recommend.Related...'A League Of Their Own' Is The Kind Of Reboot You Can Root ForSelena Gomez Developing Reboot Of '80s Classic 'Working Girl'We Couldn\u2019t Help But Wonder....Was 'And Just Like That...'

You flip on the TV and a bright blue light temporarily blinds you as the distinctive sound of a cowbell fills the room. You lean against your headboard and gaze at the screen as George Lopez and his fictional television family jump on a trampoline to War\u2019s \u201cLow Rider,\u201d and you wish you didn\u2019t have to do a mountain of homework the next day. Lopez\u2019s high-pitched catchphrase, \u201cI got this,\u201d replays in your mind as you eventually drift off to sleep.This was my nightly routine for almost two years. Episode after episode of \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d \u2015 a sitcom that most people referred to as \u201cThe George Lopez Show\u201d \u2015 kept me company during the loneliest hours of the day. The Lopez family didn\u2019t reflect my own: While I am Mexican-American, I was raised by a single white mother with two sisters who are Korean-American. Still, they became my second family. In George, specifically, I saw the dad I never had and so desperately wanted.Advertisement\n\nI\u2019m not alone in this feeling. Between 2002 and 2007, George Lopez became a father to many young kids who saw themselves reflected in his on-screen children, Carmen (Masiela Lusha) and Max (Luis Armand Garcia). Jessica Marie Garcia, an actor on Netflix\u2019s \u201cOn My Block,\u201d was one such person who saw George as a stand-in for her own father, who was rarely in her life.\u201cI felt I could have a dad in a way watching George,\u201d she told HuffPost.Garcia was 15 years old when she first saw her family represented on screen. Half Mexican, half Cuban, Garcia remembers how similar her family was to the Lopezes, especially since her grandmother lived with her at the time.\u201cI felt I could have a dad in a way watching George.\u201d- Jessica Marie Garcia, actor, \"On My Block\"\u201cMy mom and I would just laugh and laugh about all the similarities we shared, especially when [Angie]\u2019s father would come on the show because he was just like my Cuban grandfather,\u201d Garcia said, referring to Lopez\u2019s on-screen wife, played by Constance Marie. \u201cSeeing a whole Latinx family made me feel like I was seen for the first time. Like my family dynamic mattered, like we weren\u2019t the only ones.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nFor many Latinx viewers, \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d was the first time they saw themselves reflected in an American sitcom in a way that didn\u2019t focus on hardships and trauma porn. And for five full seasons, they had an almost entirely Latinx cast, something almost unheard of even by today\u2019s standards. As co-creator, writer, producer and star, Lopez leveraged his power to make a spot for Latinx actors to tell Latin-centered stories. And the show\u2019s legacy lives on: You can still catch reruns on cable TV and stream the full six seasons on various platforms almost 20 years later.A promotional image from \"George Lopez\" on ABC.ABC/Everett CollectionWhile there had been other sitcoms that focused on Latin family units prior to 2002, \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d cemented itself in Hollywood history thanks to its smart comedy and its authentic take on family and life. In fact, you could argue that \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d was the beginning of a long succession of sitcoms written by and for the Latin community \u2015 like \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d \u201cGentefied,\u201d \u201cMr. Iglesias,\u201d and soon \u201cLopez vs. Lopez,\u201d the comedian\u2019s new series featuring his daughter, Mayan. \u201cLopez vs. Lopez\u201d is set to premiere in late 2022.Some loyal viewers, like author and editor Lauren Davila, say the show opened the doors for other diverse comedies on TV like \u201cBlack-ish\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat.\u201d Growing up in a Mexican-American household, Davila recalls \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d as a major part of her childhood.\u201cI watched the [show] with my mom and sister as reruns most often [during] early mornings or late at night,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a level of comfort from seeing this complex, flawed family on TV that reminded me in many ways of the people I know and grew up with.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nDavila acknowledged that she remembers the show fondly through the lens of childhood nostalgia, and that she never viewed it with a rigorously critical eye. Still, she thinks it \u201cproved to the television industry that audiences are clamoring for representative media across the board,\u201d especially since the show depicted the home life of a multigenerational, working-class family and managed to be successful during prime time. \u201cI think it was really nice to see a family that showcased all the different ranges of what a Latinx family can look like,\u201d she said.Writer Sandra Proudman has been a fan of \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d since she was a teenager in the early 2000s. \u201cThere really were no other Latinx shows outside of Spanish-speaking networks [at the time],\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cI grew up watching telenovelas with my mom and sister, so seeing a Latinx show on an English-speaking network, well, it made me feel like we had a seat at the table in the United States as well ... It felt like home.\u201dFor Proudman, \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d was revolutionary in that it cast actual Latinx people in the roles. Some shows have come under fire for casting white actors as Latinx characters. For example, Netflix\u2019s \u201cOn My Block\u201d cast a white actor \u2014 who previously tweeted in support of Donald Trump\u2019s politics \u2014 as a young Latina whose parents were deported. Alex Nu\u00f1ez, an infamous Latina character on \u201cDegrassi: The Next Generation,\u201d was portrayed by Italian-Canadian actor Deanna Casaluce. Even Ofelia Salazar, a \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d character who is the daughter of a Salvadorian immigrant, was played by Persian-Swedish actor Mercedes Mason. The only non-Latinx cast member in Lopez\u2019s show was Lusha, who is Albanian.Advertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a time where casts were very much still primarily white, so to have a show where the characters spoke English, telling Latinx jokes, and where the cast was [almost] all brown, it was something that was invaluable,\u201d Proudman said. \u201cAt the time, I might not have realized just how much, but looking back now, it\u2019s something that was so rare and special. Even today.\u201d\u201cI think it was really nice to see a family that showcased all the different ranges of what a Latinx family can look like.\u201d- Lauren Davila, author and editorIt was the jokes in particular \u2014 jokes about hard-to-please abuelitas, hallucinogenic mezcal worms, George\u2019s massive head \u2014 that connected Garcia, Davila, Proudman and so many other Latinx viewers to \u201cGeorge Lopez.\u201d \u201cI think that was one thing that the \u2018George Lopez Show\u2019 did differently and so well, was that it didn\u2019t make Latinx people the punchline,\u201d Proudman said. \u201cWe were fully in on the jokes, and they were written to offer us laughter, not to be a source of laughter for a non-Latinx audience.\u201dThe success of \u201cGeorge Lopez\u201d made Lopez himself the first Latino to lead a television series of his own into syndication \u2014 when a program runs on a different network than it was initially created for, an achievement that usually requires a minimum of 100 episodes. But the show\u2019s ratings didn\u2019t hold up after ABC shifted its time slot to compete with the mega-popular \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d The show was ultimately, and in Lopez\u2019s words \u201cunceremoniously,\u201d canceled.Advertisement\n\nToday, it seems the networks still haven\u2019t found the value in supporting Latin-focused productions. The last few years have seen a string of painful cancellations, including \u201cDiary of a Future President,\u201d \u201cMr. Iglesias,\u201d \u201cGentefied\u201d and \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d to name just a few. Currently, there are no Latin shows left on network television, and those on streaming services often get canceled after just one season. (RIP, \u201cThe Baker and the Beauty\u201d and \u201cGordita Chronicles.\u201d) With over 18% of the U.S. population identifying as Hispanic or Latino, this seems like a major disservice to a massively underrated market. In fact, as of 2019, Latinx actors made up only 6.6% of leads on broadcast scripted TV shows. As Proudman notes, \u201cno one show can be a monolith for such a diverse group, so the more the better.\u201dGarcia, who is deeply intertwined in the behind-the-scenes happenings in Hollywood, wants her industry to show Latin viewers that their family dynamics matter too.\u201cOur shows can highlight the love we have for each other along with our dysfunction,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThat we can laugh at ourselves and argue but always come back together in the end. That after years of watching nothing but white family shows, we can finally get our happy ending after 23 minutes too.\u201dRelated...Katelina Eccleston Is Giving Black Latinas In Reggaeton Their FlowersHow TikTok Changed The Course Of Alex Aster's LifeHow Queen Latifah Helped Me Build Self-Esteem As A Fat Black Girl", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-lopez-show-this-made-me_n_6320aae5e4b0eac9f4dbb203", "title": "How The 'George Lopez' Show Brilliantly Captured Family Life"}, {"authors": "Ruth Etiesit Samuel", "date_publish": "2022-09-20T05:45:01-0400", "description": "In the Season Two finale of \"Industry,\" Harper Stern (Myha'la Herrold) is officially in the hot seat", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "In the Season Two finale of \"Industry,\" Harper Stern (Myha'la Herrold) is officially in the hot seat.Nick StrasburgThis piece contains spoilers for the Season Two finale of \u201cIndustry.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made a strong recommendation to your manager,\u201d the human resources administrator tells Harper Stern. \u201cThere\u2019s only one course of action in this scenario.\u201dThe look of betrayal, mixed with fear and disbelief, is written all over Harper\u2019s face.\u201cI have to let you go,\u201d Eric Tao says. \u201cYou\u2019re fired, Harper.\u201dThe camera frames Harper from behind: We see her neat bun and crisp, tailored blazer, but not her face.

In the pursuit of self-actualization and stability, you end up becoming reliant on something or someone new, be it money, a donor or something else altogether.Created by Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, the hit workplace drama \"Industry\" returned to HBO on Aug. 1 for its second season.HBOAt the start of the Season Two finale, audiences watch as Harper, Eric (Ken Leung), Danny Van Deventer (Alex Alomar Akpobome) and Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia) make a play to leave the seemingly sinking ship that is Pierpoint\u2019s London branch. In Episode Seven, with the New York branch apparently poised to subsume them, Eric says: \u201cThe merger isn\u2019t a merger. It\u2019s a slaughter.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of the season, Danny realizes his privilege and grapples with the fact that he is a cog in a system that perpetuates violence and overlooks abuse, leading to a tearful epiphany on the toilet. Following his stunted performance, an aging Eric is forced to ascend to the upper levels of Pierpoint\u2019s executive offices \u2014 his worst nightmare \u2014 and leave behind the trading floor. Harper, who is driven up the wall by her volatile client Jesse Bloom (Jay Duplass), knowingly helped Jesse give Rishi the wrong read.

When Nicole calls to place a large order, Robert tells her to cease contact, but Danny tells him to move forward with the purchase, since it doesn\u2019t change what happened. Be it mommy issues, a submission kink or relating to another white working-class individual who has toiled to the top, Robert initially took a liking to Nicole \u2014 that is, until he learned that she had assaulted Harper first.However, when work, pleasure and abuses of power mix, Robert is unable to escape from Nicole\u2019s grasp, calling her when he\u2019s at his lowest: in jail for substance possession.

The sexual tension between these two was palpable throughout the season, so this woman-loving-woman relationship was spotted from a mile away. After Yasmin learns that her father has a mountain of sexual assault cases against him, which is why the family\u2019s finances are frayed, she tells Celeste she doesn\u2019t think they should represent him or work with clients like her father anymore.\u201cMy point is, every dollar, every client, you probe deep enough, an advantage has been taken ...

Not so oblivious now, am I?\u201dTaking a stand for what appears to be right, Yasmin tells her father she wants nothing more to do with him. That evening, Yasmin tells Celeste that none of this is professional and they should cease doing business with him.

She learns that Amazon is set to acquire competitor Fast-Aid, as there is no regulatory anticompetition committee inquiry scheduled. Harper goes to Jesse\u2019s home, encouraging him to pull his stock (and thereby committing insider trading). He pats her down to see if there\u2019s a wire, and dismisses her. \u201cMaybe I never knew what you wanted. Thank you for the opportunity,\u201d she says.With Jesse \u2015 who was the quartet\u2019s ticket to escaping Pierpoint and joining another company \u2015 out of the picture, Harper and Eric devise a plan. In a last-ditch effort, Jesse texts Harper to find any remaining shares of Rican and buy them. In a CNN interview, capitalizing on the confidential information Harper leaked to him, Jesse speaks an anticompetition inquiry into existence. With the parliamentary buzz surrounding the deal, Gus\u2019 boss Aurore (Faith Alabi) is rewarded with a recommendation for health secretary. Full of himself, he says: \u201cI can be loose-lipped when it suits.\u201d Consequently, Gus is rewarded with job termination. Aurore tells him it\u2019s merely pragmatic \u2014 and she reminds him to keep Jesse in his debt.At the Sackey-Spearing household, Harper berates Gus (David Jonsonn) about details regarding the pending telemedicine deal.Nick StrasburgAdvertisement\n\nHarper, the woman who notoriously trusts no one, let her guard down and trusted her client to use the information for his own personal gain and to prove her loyalty to him. Yet Jesse used it to sway the entire market. She runs upstairs to Eric, frantic. There, he tells her she has two options: meet with executive Adler (Trevor White) and make a play to stay in London, or cut Jesse off and start afresh. Once again, for Harper, going home is not an option.At the meeting, Eric and Harper pitch \u201ca new superteam\u201d consisting of the best hedge fund leaders and the youngest, cheapest talent: macro hedge fund sales. Harper suggests that Rishi and wunderkind Danny are headed to the competitor, who only wants them if Harper retains Jesse, and should be cut as a form of punishment. Eric reminds Adler that if this is not executed, news could leak regarding the \u201cculture of suppression\u201d and the \u201clegal liability candy store\u201d at Pierpoint regarding Nicole\u2019s inappropriate behavior. Knowing full well that she has just set Rishi up for unemployment, Harper attends his countryside wedding, sharing drinks with him at a table. She gets a call from Eric that Adler accepted their proposal and Rishi and Danny are out, but she plays it off as her father calling her. Out of guilt, she blurts to Rishi: \u201cYou\u2019re really A-list at your job, you know. Everything\u2019s gonna work out for you.\u201dThe two snort a line of coke in the bathroom, where Harper tries to assuage Rishi\u2019s pre-wedding jitters by telling him to compartmentalize his marriage. \u201cThat\u2019s psychopath logic,\u201d he says. In an act of passion, pity or desperation for human touch, they have extremely brief, cramped sex. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just... had to get the poison out,\u201d Rishi tells her.\u201cMe too,\u201d Harper says. In the wedding pews, Harper and Yasmin rekindle their contentious friendship, laughing over the horrific things they said to one another previously.Advertisement\n\nRight before his wedding to Diana (Brittany Ashworth), Rishi (Sagar Radia) had sex with Harper, not knowing she'd thrown him under the bus at work.Nick StrasburgBack in London, Gus is sitting at dinner with Jesse and his son Leo (Sonny Poon Tip), whom Gus is dating. Using his Oxford connections, Gus got Leo into the university, so they\u2019re celebrating. When Leo leaves the room, Gus tells Jesse that he\u2019s lost his job. Jesse, who knew and understood that Harper got the confidential trading information for her housemate, enlists Gus as his personal assistant, welcoming him to a lavish life of private jets and fancy meetings. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve officially joined me on the dark side, you can sit in these meets with me,\u201d Jesse says. \u201cYou can be proud of yourself, too. These were the rooms you were born into, lest we forget.\u201d Earlier in the season, Gus had grappled with fulfillment and making a change over making a buck and appeasing the expectations of his immigrant parents. After his sister steered him away from public service and social work, Gus has made his decision: to be in servitude to his bank account.Following the wedding, everyone else at Pierpoint returns to the city. Yasmin grabs dinner with Venetia, apologizing for her callous behavior and for gaslighting her when she reported the assault.

The wunderkind has been terminated as planned. However, arriving at the CPX side of the room, Harper sees that Rishi is still there. She asks what he\u2019s doing and he responds, \u201cYou tell me.\u201dEric approaches Harper and says, \u201cFollow me for a sec.\u201d They enter the elevator, chatting casually. Eric explains that Rishi is staying, but Harper notices something is off. Eric claims that he\u2019s lightheaded and under the weather. He knows what\u2019s about to happen.The two exchange words and banter in the elevator, Harper reminiscing about her isolation days in the hotel room and thanking Eric for everything. He says, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for you.\u201d He then walks her into a room, where there\u2019s a man sitting at a table, and fear begins to rise in her spirit. She pleads with Eric: \u201cPlease, this cannot be about Jesse. I didn\u2019t know that he was going to \u2014\u201dAdvertisement\n\nEric tells her to take a seat. What the evaluator tells her has nothing to do with her botched deal from last season or the insider trading allegations. Rather, it has to do with her forged transcript from Binghamton University, where she had a panic attack due to her brother and stormed out of the final exam. The evaluator says, \u201cYour duplicity in this manner contradicts the founding principle of Pierpoint\u2019s business: honesty and integrity.\u201dIn a last-ditch attempt to save his job on the trading floor, Eric Tao (Ken Leung) devises a plan that seemingly saves both him and Harper.Nick StrasburgObjectively, Harper\u2019s behavior is often heinous and chaotic, to say the least. In Season One, she botched a massive deal. In Season Two, she misled Rishi and committed an egregious ethical error. At that level, an incomplete college transcript is unacceptable. However, there is room for nuance and multiple truths.The hypocrisy of Pierpoint \u2014 a place that begets and encourages vile behavior \u2014 impugning Harper\u2019s \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d is another instance of how the institution will never love you. No matter how much you try to co-opt, adopt or fuel their practices, as a Black woman, the sword will always fall on you, if it doesn\u2019t simply stab you in the back.What remains unclear is how the information was discovered. Throughout the season, Eric was increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of Harper outpacing him, gaining ground at Pierpoint with a world-famous client like Jesse. Despite capitalizing on Harper\u2019s mind and desperation to create a solution that Adler agreed to, her mentor Eric possibly made no efforts to keep her in the fold; rather, he likely pushed her out as she transitioned from his pet to threat in an effort to assert control and dominance.

Will she have to return home and re-enroll in school \u2014 or fight to the death in London? Now, Yasmin and Harper have ostensibly learned their lessons and are off to fend for themselves, while Gus and Robert contend with their demons.

Advertisement\n\nSmith wrapped filming on the upcoming Civil War epic from \u201cTraining Day\u201d director Antoine Fuqua, which the company acquired for a record-breaking $120 million a month before the Oscars incident. While earlier reports claimed the film\u2019s release had been delayed until 2023, the Times revealed that there have \u201cbeen discussions inside Apple to release \u2018Emancipation\u2019 by the end of the year, which would make it eligible for awards consideration,\u201d citing three anonymous sources involved with the film. Apart from the hefty price tag, the studio is reportedly convinced the film could still be an awards contender, given what the Times\u2019 sources called the \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d reactions in early screenings, especially surrounding Smith\u2019s \u201cvolcanic\u201d performance. In a feedback session after the film, audience members said they were \u201cnot turned off\u201d by the actor\u2019s outburst at the Academy Awards.\u201cEmancipation\u201d stars Smith as Peter, a runaway slave who escapes a Louisiana plantation and eventually joins the Union Army during the Civil War. The film is inspired by real-life photos, including one known as \u201cThe Scourged Back,\u201d which shows a man\u2019s whipping scars during a medical examination. The image was widely circulated after appearing in a Harper\u2019s Weekly article published in 1863 and helped expose the truth about the brutality of slavery around the world.

But with widespread internet usage and the rise of various social media platforms, this information is not only accessible quickly, but harder to remove.If you ever find yourself wondering whether you can erase yourself from the web, you are not alone. According to a 2022 research survey by NordVPN, 55% of Americans wish they could delete themselves from the internet, and another 42% fear that someone is going to hack them. Advertisement\n\nWiping your private information from the internet is a difficult task, and there is rarely a guarantee that anything removed will stay offline permanently. But minimizing your digital footprint is possible.According to Daniel Markuson, a digital privacy expert at NordVPN, you can take a number of steps to start wiping your personal information.1. Google Yourself The first step is to understand what information about you is out there. When you share something online, you give up control over that piece of data, so Google yourself to see what photos and personal information exists on the web.According to Markuson, you can start by identifying any sites you\u2019ve used that would host your data, including forums and websites you personally own. Perform a Google search for your information on sites that may have cloned or logged your data so you are familiar with what\u2019s out there.Advertisement\n\n2. Delete, Deactivate And ClearOnce you\u2019ve tracked down this information, remove whatever data you can and then either delete, anonymize or deactivate your accounts.You\u2019ll need to delete your social media profiles \u2014 especially with notorious bad actors like Facebook \u2014 and if you truly want to leave no trace, delete your accounts with online shopping, dating and other services, like Skype or Dropbox.Keep in mind that you still need to remove data from apps and sites that you no longer use. Also note that it may take a while for search engines to clear their caches, which temporarily capture and store website data.But that\u2019s not all.3. Opt Out Of Data Brokers (And Do It Regularly)\u201cYou also need to painfully \u2014 one by one \u2014 opt out of data brokers,\u201d Markuson said, referring to organizations that scrape the internet for private information that can be sold to third parties.When you Googled yourself, you might have seen your information come up in results for popular data broker sites like Spokeo, MyLife, Whitepages, BeenVerified, Intelius and others that create online profiles of people.Advertisement\n\nWhitepagesYou can request to remove your personal information from data broker sites like WhitePages, but each one has to be handled individually unless you join a service to do it for you.There are tools like DeleteMe that help take down your information from data brokers. DeleteMe offers a free opt-out guide to help you request the removal of information from many of these sites \u2014 but annoyingly, you\u2019ll have to handle each of them individually if you do it on your own.Data is typically refreshed on most data broker websites every three months, so you\u2019ll also need to check them regularly to stay on track.Alternatively, you can set up a DeleteMe membership for about $129 per year. The company can help remove you from over 30 top data broker sites in the U.S. and keeps doing so for as long as your subscription lasts. When you sign up for DeleteMe, you can choose the number of people \u2014 yourself plus any family members or business colleagues, for example \u2014 and the number of years you\u2019d like included in your subscription. If you discovered information on platforms in the U.K. or European Union, consider signing up for Incogni, which has the capacity to remove your data from over 130 data brokers for about $70 a year. Before selecting a service, do your research on how many data broker sites it reaches and compare price points.Advertisement\n\nGal Ringel, the CEO at Mine, an \u201call-in-one privacy suite\u201d focused on data privacy rights, also recommends enlisting professional help if these steps are difficult for you to manage alone. Mine says it works as a personalized \u201csmart data assistant\u201d to help discover and manage your data online.\u201cSaymine.com helps you minimize your digital risks by allowing you to discover all the companies that hold your personal data and the associated risks, and enables you to send official data deletion requests to the companies,\u201d Ringel said about his product, which is currently free but has a premium version planned for the future.\u201cIf you find your personal information on other websites, you can always send a request to ask for them to delete it in the hopes that they will follow through,\u201d he added.If they don\u2019t, \u201cGoogle also has tools and processes to help you wipe unwanted results from the web,\u201d Markuson said.These methods are not permanent solutions but are intended to minimize your online presence. You can set yourself a quarterly reminder to run through these steps and checks again.Advertisement\n\n4. Pursue Legal Remedies If Necessary There are also some legal actions to pursue when content is online without your consent. With measures like the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the U.S., there are legal rights to protect data and consequences in the event of violations. \u201cExamples of legal actions are the many GDPR and CCPA fines,\u201d said Ringel. If an organization fails to protect an individual\u2019s personal data, it can face serious penalties.Recently, for example, cosmetics giant Sephora was fined $1.2 million because it failed to disclose that it was selling consumers\u2019 personal information and did not honor requests to opt-out of these sales. If you need to take legal action to remove information from the internet, get in touch with a lawyer for assistance. You should be empowered to use the internet on your own terms while also remaining diligent and cautious about how your information is presented online.

In the midst of packing for your vacation, it\u2019s normal that medications may slip your mind. If you realize while traveling that you forgot your medications, it\u2019s important that you act quickly in order to avoid gaps in your prescription regimen. \u201cTry your best to avoid stopping your medications abruptly,\u201d Sethi Young said. \u201cThis can have serious health effects.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, make sure not to change your medication or take something in its place \u2015 e.g., over-the-counter medicine or an alternate drug \u2015 as that can also put your health into danger. Here\u2019s what you can do to obtain forgotten medication if you\u2019re away from home.Contact your doctor\u2019s office immediately. Once you realize that you forgot a medication, get in touch with the doctor who prescribed it. Try calling their office or sending a message via your patient portal as soon as possible. \u201cYour physician\u2019s office may be able to fax or email a note of your latest medical consultation or summary of your health conditions and medications with dosing instructions,\u201d Desai said. If you\u2019re traveling domestically in the U.S., they may even be able to transfer your prescription to a pharmacy near you. If you\u2019re unable to reach your physician, get in touch with your pharmacy back home. The pharmacy where you go to collect your prescription has a record of your medications. Therefore, if you\u2019re unable to get in touch with your doctor, contact a pharmacist back home so they can locate the exact names of your medications and associated dosing, Sethi Young said. Advertisement\n\nstaticnak1983 via Getty ImagesDon't try switching your regimen or taking a different medication in place of your normal one. Call your physician first.Visit a local pharmacy at your destination. Once you receive a copy of your medication record, take it to a local pharmacy, as you may be able to purchase your prescription medications there. Make sure to visit either a hospital-based pharmacy or a reputable chain pharmacy and insist on original packaging of the medication, Desai said.Remember to keep the receipts from your purchase, because you may get some form of reimbursement if you have travel insurance, Desai added. Each country has its own rules regarding the sale of prescription medications. So if you\u2019re denied medications after showing your prescription from your doctor, you may have to visit a local physician for a new prescription. Visit an urgent care or internal medicine clinic. Urgent care centers and medical clinics with internal medicine physicians are generally knowledgeable about a variety of health conditions, Desai said. She recommends that you take a list of your current medications and medical conditions from your primary care provider during a visit. Advertisement\n\nGenerally, internal medicine or family medicine physicians who act as general practitioners can prescribe a variety of medications. If the local internal medicine physician is unable to help with your prescription, they may refer you to a specialized physician who can. The process to retrieve your forgotten medications may seem stressful, but don\u2019t panic. There are medical professionals who can support you and help you gain access to your medicine, Sethi Young said.

Cue powder gel manicures, which have become an increasingly popular option, offering the quick-drying, chip-free qualities we love in gel manicures while also lasting even longer. But is it bad to get regular gel manicures? Should you be taking breaks in between? Nail techs will tell you one thing, but HuffPost wanted to get the answer from board-certified dermatologists who can give the straight scoop about nail health. Here\u2019s what they had to say.Advertisement\n\nWhat is powder gel?Unlike traditional gel, powder gel does not need to cure under a UV or LED light. Instead, nails are dipped into a pot of colored powder made of titanium dioxide, benzoyl peroxide and acrylic ester polymer and an activator made of ethyl acetate, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine is brushed on top to lock in the polish. Once the activator is on, the powder gel sets. Dip powder manicures tend to last longer than traditional gel \u2015 up to five weeks with proper prep, application and maintenance, compared to two to three weeks for traditional gel, since the glue used to apply it contains cyanoacrylate (the main ingredient in Krazy Glue).        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Nailboo\u00ae (@nailboo) Powder gel removal can be super dryingPowder gel is more difficult to remove than traditional gel. Both involve some soaking in acetone, but powder gel requires a longer soak to break down the product. Longer exposure to acetone can dry out your nails and even irritate your hands and cuticles, so it\u2019s important to moisturize afterward with plenty of cuticle oil, cuticle serum and hand cream. Keep some in your purse, at your desk and on your nightstand to remind yourself to hydrate throughout the day.Taking breaks in between powder gel applications can be beneficial\u201cRegardless of what type of manicure you are using, it is always good to take a break in between applications, at least once a month,\u201d said Dr. Tamara Lazic Strugar, a board-certified dermatologist at Hudson Dermatology and Laser Surgery and an associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cRegular nail polish is least harmful, whereas gels (regular and powder) are more harmful and acrylics the most.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nLazic notes that while it might be nice to have a manicure on for a month or more, the longer that any polish or chemical sits on the nail, the more damage it causes. The removal process for powder gels can also be damaging, not only because of the longer acetone soak, but also because powder gel requires more physical scraping to remove, which thins and dehydrates the nail plate. \u201cIf the technician is too aggressive with the electric filing and the nail matrix gets damaged, this can result in nail discoloration and sometimes even lumps and scarring,\u201d Lazic said. \u201cAlso, keep in mind that continued exposure to the many chemicals found in gel manicures can cause sensitization and skin allergies.\u201d She recommends taking breaks between manicures if you can \u2014 at least a week, but ideally a month. If you don\u2019t want bare nails, consider using regular polish during your break.If your skin and nails seem to be tolerating dip gel manicures well, taking breaks might not be necessary. \u201cMost people get gels done about every three weeks in conjunction with the natural nail growth cycle,\u201d said Dr. Janet Allenby, a board certified-dermatologist and founder of Allenby Cosmetic Dermatology. \u201cMost people tolerate them well, and it may actually be uncomfortable to give them a break since the hardened surface of powder gel is more durable than our natural nail.\u201d Dr. Corey Hartman, a board-certified dermatologist at Skin Wellness Dermatology, echoed Allenby\u2019s view, noting that regular gel powder manicures are fine as long as neither the powder nor the gel causes any irritation or allergic contact dermatitis.Signs it\u2019s time to take a breakNo matter how often you\u2019re getting powder gel manicures, it\u2019s a good idea to check in between applications to see if a break is necessary. If you\u2019re seeing anything abnormal on or around your nails, like an infection, allergic reaction or dermatitis, or you\u2019re experiencing any inflammation or pain, Allenby recommends discontinuing powder gel manicures until the issue is resolved. \u201cIf there is any pigment other than the natural pink of the bed you should stop and see a dermatologist,\u201d she said. \u201cAll races are susceptible to malignant melanoma of the nail bed.\u201d Advertisement\n\nLazic added that when you notice whitish or yellow discoloration of your nails, cracking or dryness, it is time for a break and some hydration. She recommends using plain Vaseline or Aquaphor on the nails and cuticles to help hydrate and heal them.Beyond topical products, Allenby notes that good nutrition, supplements and a healthy lifestyle are the best ways to keep your nails in good shape. \u201cNails, like hair, are a reflection of our health and age,\u201d she said.So, are constant powder gel manicures bad for you?It depends. If you have sensitive skin that\u2019s prone to drying out and becoming irritated, the application and removal process of powder gel may exacerbate skin sensitivity. To help minimize your risk for a bacterial or fungal infection, Lazic recommends ensuring the salon you\u2019re going to doesn\u2019t use a communal jar for dip powder. \u201cYou should not be dipping your fingers in a jar used by someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cSalons should use individual disposable jars for each client.\u201dAs for nail products in general, whether you\u2019re using powder gel, regular nail polish, gel or something else, Allenby notes that it depends on how much exposure to chemicals you\u2019re willing to accept and the health of your nails. \u201cThe nail is basically the same as a modified hair shaft, which grows as an inert nail from below the cuticle area,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bed under the nail is live, delicate, susceptible to injury and has availability to absorb chemicals.\u201dRelated...My Gel Manicure Horror Story Made Me Wonder: Is This Even Safe?Your Fingernails Are Showing Your Age.

When the heck did there become so many different types of tortilla chips?Yellow corn or blue corn? Scoops or triangles? Lightly salted or hint-of-lime? It\u2019s enough to have you thinking that the party guest who volunteered to make cupcakes from scratch got off easy. Advertisement\n\nFor advice on how to buy the best-tasting tortilla chips \u2014 and which ones to skip \u2014 we asked 10 Mexican chefs what to look for. After all, they\u2019ve perfected making tortilla chips themselves, whether it\u2019s to serve in their restaurants, feature in their cookbooks or simply enjoy at home. So, what do they keep in mind? Follow the six steps below and you\u2019ll be led to the perfect tortilla chips every time.1. Buy them from Mexican-owned shops or brandsInstead of heading to the grocery store for your tortilla chips, it\u2019s worth it to do a quick Google search first to see if there\u2019s a Mexican grocery store nearby to make your purchase. \u201cMy favorite tortilla chips are available at most Mexican grocery stores. It\u2019s the one with no brand that\u2019s likely made at the store,\u201d said chef Katsuji Tanabe, who owns six restaurants across North America. Advertisement\n\nIf you spot perfectly golden tortilla chips in a clear bag with no brand name, you know you\u2019ve found what you came in for. Tanabe said chips like these are made with real corn tortillas and are thick enough to be used for anything from chips and salsa to making chilaquiles.If there isn\u2019t a Mexican grocery store near you, the next-best thing you can do is support a Mexican-owned brand. Esteban Castillo, the creator of Mexican cooking resource Chicano Eats and author of a cookbook with the same name, said he favors Siete\u2019s grain-free tortilla chips both for their ingredients and because the brand gives back to the Latinx community.Lola Wiarbo Dweck, the founder of Mexican cooking resource Lola\u2019s Cocina, does too. \u201cI like that they\u2019re made with avocado oil and chia seeds,\u201d she said.Dweck is also a fan of Mi Rancho 7th Street corn tortilla chips, which are made with organic ingredients. \u201cThey\u2019re as close to homemade as it gets!\u201d she shared.2. Look for the perfect thicknessIf you want to avoid your chip breaking off while you\u2019re scooping up some guac, consider thickness.A \u201cthicker size is closest to a homemade tortilla chip,\u201d said Mely Martinez, the founder of Mexican recipe website Mexico In My Kitchen. \u201cThin chips break easily and lack the corn flavor of a good tortilla.\u201d Advertisement\n\n(For the record, Martinez said that if she isn\u2019t getting her tortilla chips straight from a Mexican grocery store, she\u2019ll pick up a bag of X\u00f3chitl chips, which she said deliver on the perfect thickness.)Castillo said perfect tortilla chips aren\u2019t too brittle or too thick; they\u2019re just right. After all, you\u2019re likely pairing your chips with salsa, quac or another food, and an overly thick chip can be overpowering.3. Look for chips made with nixtamalized yellow cornTo really appreciate the corn flavor of your chips, Maricruz Avalos, who shares Mexican recipes online, and Dora Stone, the creator of Mexican recipe website Dora\u2019s Table, both say to look for chips made with nixtamalized corn.During the nixtamalization process, dried maize kernels are cooked and steeped in an alkaline solution, most commonly filtered water and lime. Not only are they more flavorful, but nixtamalized corn chips are higher in B vitamins. Avalos uses them to make chilaquiles, \u201cbecause they hold up the salsa wonderfully,\u201d and also as topping for soups, \u201cespecially for sopa Azteca.\u201d Advertisement\n\nChef Carlos Gayt\u00e1n said the best chips are made with yellow corn, full stop. \u201cThe others that are white or blue corn are not so crunchy because they absorb a lot of the oil with which they are made,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, the yellow [corn] tortilla, when fried between 375\u00b0F and 400\u00b0F, is super crispy and delicious.\u201d4. Look for a short and simple ingredients listHint-of-lime, guac-flavored tortilla chips, taco flavor \u2014 none of the Mexican chefs we talked to go for flavors like these. \u201cI don\u2019t like lime-flavored tortilla chips. The lime artificial flavor really bothers me for some reason. I would rather squeeze some fresh lime on my chips,\u201d Stone said.Tanabe saids he skips tortilla chips that are dyed blue, red or green. The shorter the ingredients list on your chip bag, the closer to homemade they\u2019ll be.Jennifer A Smith via Getty ImagesCan you spot what's wrong with these?Advertisement\n\n5. They shouldn\u2019t be overly salty Many of the Mexican chefs say that when it comes to saltiness, the perfect tortilla chips have neither too little nor too much. If your chips are overly salty and you\u2019re enjoying them with another food that has salt (like guac), the saltiness will be overpowering. Yvette Marquez-Sharpnack, the author of \u201dMuy Bueno Cookbook,\u201d said that if she isn\u2019t picking up her chips from a local Mexican grocery store, she\u2019ll go for La Favorita or Xochitl tortilla chips, which she says are perfectly lightly salted and not overly so. 6. Make sure they\u2019re triangle-shaped\u201cI don\u2019t like round, strips or scoops,\u201d Marquez-Sharpnack said. If your tortilla chips are the perfect thickness already, they don\u2019t need a special shape in order to be the perfect vehicle for salsa, queso or guac. With these tips in mind, you\u2019re well on your way to buying the best tortilla chips out there.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change.With so many bedding options to choose from for getting a good night\u2019s sleep, finding sheets that are comfy, durable and affordable can feel impossible. Do you splurge on percale or silk? Snuggle up with eucalyptus, flannel or linen? The decision is even harder if you\u2019re a hot sleeper who often wakes up in a pool of sweat and hasn\u2019t yet found the holy grail of sheets that won\u2019t make you feel like you slept in a damp towel all night. Advertisement\n\nBut what if I told you there\u2019s one bed sheet set that\u2019s hot-sleeper approved (by me) and has a softness that oozes luxury without the heavy price tag? Introducing LuxClub\u2019s bamboo sheets, which come in over 40 attractive colors like lavender, burnt orange, olive green, rose gold, emerald green and sky blue.In addition to being ridiculously soft, bamboo sheets are known for their breathability and being gentle on sensitive skin. LuxClub\u2019s sheets, which have over 119,000 five-star reviews Amazon, are made of a cozy bamboo fabric blended with microfibers and are equipped with moisture-wicking technology. They even have deep, elastic pockets so you don\u2019t have to worry about your fitted sheet snapping back in the middle of the night. $27.95+ at AmazonAdvertisement\n\nI immediately bought these sheets after seeing them raved about on TikTok and have been using them on my full-sized bed for a little over two weeks. I purchased them in silver to match the rest of my bedding and am already planning to get them again in another color (to go with my future fall aesthetic, perhaps). Like I previously mentioned, I am an extremely hot sleeper, even during the colder months, and have found myself feeling less overheated at night while slumbering on these sheets. They don\u2019t completely stop me from sweating, but I definitely don\u2019t wake up in a daze wondering when I decided to nap in a sauna. Before putting them on my bed, I washed and dried them and noticed little to no wrinkles, which is always a plus for getting that sleek and crisp hotel look we all love. But if you still need a little more convincing to elevate your snooze time with just one easy swap, peruse these glowing Amazon reviews: \u201cThese sheets are amazing. This is my second set. Stays cool, very soft, and so durable! My cats tend to sink their claws into the bed and with standard sheets I always had snags. After a year the first set I bought did not have and snags or pulls. I bought a second color recently, the quality is just as good on these. Deep pockets too, fit my 12 inch mattress with no issues!\u201d \u2014 portermom 123 \u201cI was searching for a sheet set that would help me sleep more comfortably at night and found these. I have terrible hot flashes with night sweats and get up in the morning just miserable. Of course, these do not eliminate my hot flashes as no sheets will, but they definitely make my nights much more comfortable by eliminating wet bedding and I definitely appreciate that! Aside from their moisture wicking abilities, they are very soft, easy to look at and launder extremely well. I would highly recommend these for anyone shopping for sheet sets and especially for anyone experiencing night sweats!!\u201d \u2014 Shannon Warfel \u201cFor years I\u2019ve bought expensive, high thread count Egyptian cotton sheets for our king size bed, but during a spell of hot weather last summer I decided to try these \u2015 our first bamboo set.

Since then, there\u2019s been heated debate over its purpose and even its name.Some believe the term \u201cHispanic\u201d reduces a large, nuanced and very complex portion of the U.S. population to a monolith; the term often invokes an identity that\u2019s unfamiliar or even rejected by many of the people it is meant to celebrate. Others believe that it unites us. As we slide between Hispanic, Latinx, Latine, and any other term that we feel identifies us best, I invite you to reflect on how each of us brings a unique, vibrant, unbreakable thread to the tapestry.I\u2019ve always identified simply as Puertorrique\u00f1a from Bayam\u00f3n, where my parents raised me until I moved to New York City, where I was forced to fit into a category that made others comfortable with my identity: Hispanic, Latino/a/e/x. On a daily basis, I had to correct a handful of people that called me \u201cSpanish.\u201d No, we\u2019re not \u201cSpanish\u201d just because we speak the language, just like not everyone who speaks English is \u201cEnglish.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nIn most Latino households in and out of the U.S., the month-long tribute to us goes completely unnoticed. Instead, we focus on celebrating the holidays that are specific to our individual cultures and the traditions that keep us close to our heritage \u2015 for instance, the Puerto Rican Day parade in Florida or New York, as well as D\u00eda de los Muertos for the Mexican community. A lingering question remains every year: Who is Latine Heritage Month really for? Nuestra gente, or corporate America as an excuse to bombard la comunidad with advertising in the hopes to speak to the Latinx consumer that\u2019s often overlooked year-round? See, we celebrate our cultura every single day of the year. It\u2019s time to center the artists and creators who ensure that the conversations don\u2019t end in October. HuffPost\u2019s newly relaunched Voices puts people at the heart and forefront of every single story, 365 days a year. The mic is always passed to reveal a diverse range of topics, perspectives and realities in a sincere and relatable voice. That\u2019s why I am honored to have curated a set of stories that highlight how our community has greatly impacted the fabric of American culture and history as we know it today. It will inevitably kickstart a movement of content in the section that represents all of our experiences unapologetically and authentically.Latinx trailblazers \u2014 and the stories we tell \u2014 deserve a platform that allows our work to be seen as mainstream brilliance. Every day is Latine Heritage Month for us. I hope this collection helps those outside the community understand what we so eagerly celebrate, and what we\u2019re happily leaving behind.Advertisement\n\nVamos pa\u2019 lante, Victoria Related...George Floyd Pardon DeniedBiden Says Presidential Run In 2024 \u2018Remains To Be Seen\u2019Andrew Cuomo's Former Assistant Sues Him Over Sexual Harassment", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hispanic-heritage-month-victoria-leandra_n_63247f46e4b000d9885af107", "title": "Here, Every Month Is Latine Heritage Month"}, {"authors": "Victoria Leandra", "date_publish": "2022-09-19T15:32:26-0400", "description": "Ask any young Puerto Rican where they were and who they were with when Bad Bunny dropped his first album back in 2018", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "HuffPost", "maintext": "Ask any young Puerto Rican where they were and who they were with when Bad Bunny dropped his first album back in 2018. It was Christmas Eve, and to many, it was a gift to his island. I was in a car in Puerto Rico when I listened to \u201cX 100PRE\u201d for the first time, vibrating with a childlike excitement. Within seconds, my friend who was driving stopped at a parking lot so we could fully enjoy the rhythm of each song, diving into the lyrics that appeared coded specifically for those from the island. Since then, it\u2019s become a ritual to listen to his albums on the night they drop. I listened to \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d alone in bed. \u201cYHLQMDLG\u201d was more of a community event; I hosted a listening party in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, so my Puerto Rican friends and I could devour the album together and evaluate all the tracks in detail. Despite Bad Bunny\u2019s colossal crossover into the mainstream, these memories resonate because his work will always signify something different to our community. Advertisement\n\n\u201cFor those of us in the diaspora, his music is a way to connect to home. It\u2019s comforting to listen to him refer to places I used to go to when I was living on the island,\u201d said Aurora Santiago Ortiz, assistant professor of Latinx studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Scholars and teenage TikTokers alike express a sense of intimacy with the music, which speaks to us as only a local can.One line in particular from one of his early hits, \u201cT\u00fa No Metes Cabra,\u201d serves as a prophecy of sorts: \u201cla nueva religi\u00f3n, yo soy la nueva era\u201d (the new religion, I am the new era). For Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny has served as a cultural touchstone, but to the world now, he is a ubiquitous pop icon. The man is everywhere you look: billboards, award ceremonies, magazine covers and Hollywood. Hundreds of fans of all ethnicities inked his signature heart on their bodies to celebrate a new album. Bad Bunny performs at RingCentral Coliseum on Sept. 14, 2022, in Oakland, California. The rapper is \"writing a historical account of what we are feeling and witnessing today,\" the author writes.Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesDuring the past year, while the entire world has become enraptured by Bad Bunny, he\u2019s been streaming incredible numbers \u2014 all while exclusively speaking Puerto Rican Spanish, retaining a crucial part of his identity. Advertisement\n\n\u201cI always knew that I could become a huge artist without changing my culture, my slang, and my language. I am Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, from Puerto Rico to the world,\u201d Bad Bunny said after he was named Artist of the Year at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards.  Growing up, I was made to feel that Puerto Rican Spanish \u2014 notable for its combination of Ta\u00edno (Indigenous) and Spanish sounds with African pronunciations such as \u201cRs\u201d often pronounced as \u201cLs\u201d \u2014 was inferior to that of other Spanish-speaking countries. To witness a Caribbean dialect once stigmatized by both Latinos and non-Latinos become part of the mainstream cultural fabric is huge. It\u2019s a sign to the younger generations that you don\u2019t actually need to change who you are to fit in, as other artists have done in the past.For us, Bad Bunny will never be pop. He is a cultural storyteller, a modern-day folk artist narrating the complexity of la puertorrique\u00f1idad. See, Boricua culture is perceived as too American for the rest of Latin America and too Latino to be considered a part of U.S. society, a dichotomy that makes it challenging to navigate life both inside and outside the island. The blended identity is often seen as too much and not enough all at the same time, which takes a toll on our self-worth. Bad Bunny\u2019s words and swagger make us feel seen at our most powerful and vulnerable. Although his music resonates globally, he\u2019s speaking about la brega, something only Boricuas can truly understand because we\u2019ve experienced it.For me, the lyrics to the songs \u201cComo Antes\u201d and \u201cEstamos Bien\u201d are unmistakably Boricua and provoke a certain nostalgia for those who grew up in the \u201990s. Lyrics from the latter \u2014 \u201cLa Mercedes en PR cogiendo boquete\u201d \u2014 describe the countless potholes Puerto Rico\u2019s roads are notorious for. The line is a reminder of the island\u2019s shoddy infrastructure, a sign of neglect by the larger U.S. system.Also in \u201cEstamos Bien,\u201d he raps, \u201cPa\u2019 casa no ha llega\u2019o la luz,\u201d describing the everyday reality of unreliable electricity, which is treated more as a luxury than a basic necessity by the powers that be. The lyric feels especially poignant this week, as the island, currently without power, reels from Hurricane Fiona\u2019s wrath.Advertisement\n\nIn the same song \u2014 a track that spans rage and joy \u2014 Bad Bunny raps about \u201cLas peleas de boxeo, to\u2019 los party de perreo.\u201d Growing up in Puerto Rico, three events were treated as a national celebration and cause for unity regardless of one\u2019s circumstances: any sporting event where our own represented la isla \u2014 in this case, boxer Tito Trinidad; the Miss Universe pageant; and of course, parties de marquesina. For us, despite the circumstances, partying is a radical act of resistance. For us, Bad Bunny will never be pop. He is a cultural storyteller, a modern-day folk artist narrating the complexity of la puertorrique\u00f1idad.While Bad Bunny tells the world of our struggles and successes, we Puerto Ricans are the ones who can process the nuance of his stories. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the few artists who unapologetically speaks in his music about his culture and identity, regardless of whether others can understand him or his references,\u201d said David Hern\u00e1ndez, a music industry executive in Miami. \u201cThe world cannot understand most of it but he doesn\u2019t care. On top of that, people actually learn them in order to understand him.\u201d In this way, Bad Bunny is our ambassador to the world.Written amid constant blackouts in Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny\u2019s recent ode to the island, \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n,\u201d serves as the anthem of a generation fed up with the difficulties of dealing with a crumbling infrastructure and an incompetent government while living in a tropical paradise. That\u2019s the duality of \u201cPuerto Rico est\u00e1 bien cabr\u00f3n,\u201d a prime example of this balance between enjoying life\u2019s simplest pleasures \u2014 love, sex, going to the beach, partying \u2014 and teetering on the edge of social collapse.

Beyond being the voice of a generation, Bad Bunny amplifies the conversation of a particular community within Latin America, one that has lived through an economic collapse, survived Hurricane Maria, earthquakes and political corruption. It\u2019s a generation that\u2019s been denied opportunities, and often, a unified voice.\u201cOftentimes when we think about folk music, we think about \u2018El Topo\u2019 or \u2018La Canci\u00f3n Protesta.\u2019 Those were examples of folk music in the moments in which they were created,\u201d said Jorell A. Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo, assistant professor of Latin American and Caribbean History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cBad Bunny is the music of Puerto Rico post-2006, when the current economic crisis began. [He\u2019s a] reflection of Puerto Rico\u2019s reality, and his music a sonic archive of what Puerto Ricans are going through today \u2014 even when he\u2019s talking about \u2018dar tabla.\u2019\u201dThe artist himself apparently agrees. \u201cI never made a song thinking, \u2018Man, this is for the world. This is to capture the gringo audience.\u2019 Never. On the contrary, I make songs as if only Puerto Ricans were going to listen to them,\u201d Bad Bunny told writer Carina Chocano in a recent GQ interview. \u201cI still think I\u2019m there making music, and it\u2019s for Puerto Ricans. I forget the entire world listens to me.\u201d Throughout the island\u2019s history, Puerto Ricans have used various musical genres to express their frustration with the systems that oppress them. Salsa brought attention to discrimination and poverty within the Nuyorican community, bomba has historically played a role in the island\u2019s protest movements, as has plena, which originated as a way to recite daily news and often satirize local politicians. It later developed into a vital part of the community\u2019s expression, better known today as \u201cthe newspaper of our people.\u201d Reggaet\u00f3n, many can argue, has been a political tool since its inception. Bad Bunny may not be using the traditional instruments of g\u00fciro and cuatro or reciting d\u00e9cimas. But he\u2019s writing a historical account of what we are feeling and witnessing today. When I was a child growing up en la isla, my parents took me to festivals in the local plazas to witness our trovadores. With that same intention, I know I will play Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201cAndrea\u201d for my future kids.Advertisement\n\nLike pleneros, Bad Bunny, the eldest son of a truck driver father and a schoolteacher mother, is a j\u00edbaro from Vega Baja.

For the uninitiated: The platform, which launched in 2015 but blew up during the pandemic for obvious reasons, is made up of various spaces that allow people to chat in real time while engaging in other activities simultaneously. Some of these spaces, called servers, are public while others are private and invite-only. They\u2019re all created, however, to gather like-minded individuals \u2014 think gaming, anime and, thankfully, queer-centered servers.A recent Google search for \u201ctransgender Discord servers\u201d revealed 865 public servers tagged as \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d 85 as \u201ctrans,\u201d and 29 as \u201cnonbinary.\u201d Many of these spaces serve as a support group of sorts \u2014 a form of therapy where trans users feel comfortable exchanging valuable intel about where they got their hormones, advice on how to come out to a parent, or how to immigrate to a country where it\u2019s legal to be transgender, for example. There are also compassionate and candid conversations among server members about feminizing or masculinizing beauty and fashion \u2014 advice about expressing your most authentic physical self that comes from personal experience. This resource pooling can be helpful, or even lifesaving, for people living in transgender resource deserts. While some might have a mentor they can contact, or an institution (i.e., school, church, or community centers like the YMCA and Planned Parenthood), others really just have the vast, sometimes cold, expanse of the internet.Advertisement\n\nAshleigh Hill and Leigho SweetGrass Remster are co-leaders of the Transgender Community Center Discord server to help those who identify as trans connect and pool resources. \u201cThe Transgender Community Center wanted to create space that was just for us,\u201d they said.By centering transgender users, individuals can spend less time educating cisgender users about the 101s of identity and focus more on meeting trans-specific needs. \u201cWe wanted to have a space where we just get it,\u201d Remster said. Transpeak, a server currently owned by Luna Youngquist, admits a small number of those who identify as cisgender users (approximately 5% of members), but mostly aims to cater to trans people. \u201cEven before [Discord] we started life on Teamspeak, and back in 2014, the world was a very different place,\u201d she said. The policy of primarily admitting transgender users, she says, evolved from the sentiment that there is a need to educate and support, and those resources can\u2019t be found outside of a concentrated community of transgender people. For cisgender users who may have transition-related questions, the server has a \u201cTransition Questions\u201d channel. The reality is that queer havens exist on several social media platforms \u2014 TikTok users, especially, have been bringing clever and informative content that deserves all the props. But in a political climate particularly hostile to queer people, our collective goal should be about more than information; it should be about protecting trans users from all forms of violence.Advertisement\n\nThe hope, for many Discord community leaders, is to prevent and combat harassment transgender individuals consistently face online. In 2021, ADL reported that 64% of LGBTQ+ survey respondents experienced online harassment, and 36% experienced \u201csevere harassment,\u201d which includes physical threats, doxing, stalking and swatting \u2014 where hoax 911 calls are placed en masse in order to draw police to a victim\u2019s location.Clara Sorrenti, also known as Keffals online, at her home in Ontario, Canada, June 14, 2022.The Washington Post via Getty ImagesA recent example of online harassment involes Canadian transgender activist and Twitch streamer Clara Sorrenti, better known online as Keffals. In August 2022, Sorrenti was swatted by members of an online community, part of which assembled on the online forum Kiwi Farms. Later in September, Kiwi Farms was dropped by multiple service providers, due to its blatant enabling of Sorrenti\u2019s harassment. Incidents like these are unfortunately pretty common on live chat or streaming platforms, primarily for their fast-paced, type-and-send engagement formats in chat rooms versus public online forums like Reddit, where moderation is somewhat easier to enforce. While every single platform we use has a Terms of Service agreement prohibiting abusive behavior, there\u2019s not nearly enough moderation in any of these spaces. According to a Discord spokesperson, creating a safer online environment includes creating a \u201ccounter-extremism sub-team\u201d that identifies and removes harmful Discord communities targeting racial, religious and gender minorities before they are even reported.Outside of moderation, the primary goal of trans-centered servers is to start as safe as possible and make the rules and intentions of the space clear. Doing this requires keen intuition. For example, the TCC forbids the advocacy of topics viewed as damaging in the transgender community. One example is transmedicalism, the theory that transgender identity is only valid when the conditions for gender dysphoria are met, and the individual seeks medical care. \u201cI have been affected by transmedicalism, and it\u2019s not a fun time,\u201d Leigho says. \u201cIt makes you vicious towards yourself when trans people already face a level of viciousness [in real life].\u201dAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, the safest way for transgender individuals to avoid harassment is to avoid the internet altogether. But digitally ostrich-ing ourselves is just as bad as hiding in the house because our world is propped up by harmful, heteronormative structures. Platforms such as Discord are asking the important questions about what a trans-affirmative work and play culture look like. On and offline, we\u2019d all benefit from doing the same.Related...Give These Elderqueer Heroes Their Flowers AlreadyWhy Our Collective Queer Rage Matters In A Post-Roe EraIf You Think My Pronouns Are Optional, We Can't Keep Being Friends", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/transgender-safe-space-discord_n_632350cbe4b027aa4063c7e1", "title": "How Discord Is Creating Safe Spaces For Trans People"}, {"authors": "Anya Zoledziowski", "date_publish": "2020-01-23T11:00:00.000Z", "description": "Ottawa Catholic School Board is revitalizing its Grade 11 English curriculum by swapping out the old reading list\u2014saturated with white authors like Shakespeare, F", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "Vice", "maintext": "Ottawa Catholic School Board is revitalizing its Grade 11 English curriculum by swapping out the old reading list\u2014saturated with white authors like Shakespeare, F.

The reading lists challenge harmful Indigenous stereotypes often found in media and teach Canadian histories\u2014the residential school system, and the forced removal of Indigenous kids from their homes into foster care during the Sixties Scoop, for instance\u2014that have been historically overlooked in classrooms.The push to introduce kids to Indigenous writing is in line with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Calls to Action, which recommend a mandatory \u201cage-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal peoples\u2019 historical and contemporary contributions to Canada\u201d for students in Kindergarten through Grade 12.

It\u2019s a great sign when school boards are willing to take the initiative to include a wider array of voices. It wasn\u2019t like that at all when I was in high school; I was exposed to Indigenous literature outside of the classroom. An aunt of mine who was a teacher recognized I was into English and creative writing. She gave me Thomas King and Richard Wagamese. I was fortunate that she showed me some of that great work that was happening, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have known. When I talk to other people who were in Ontario in the \u201890s, we all basically read the same books. Think about it: you\u2019re conditioning a whole generation of people to only understand one voice. It\u2019s great that kids nowadays are seeing a more diverse reading list.Advertisement'I felt like an initiative instead of a person'Terese Mailhot, Heart Berries: A Memoir, Seabird Island Band, British ColumbiaImage courtesy of Terese Mailhot.It\u2019s important to try to understand or look at something through an Indigenous lens. It\u2019s also important to showcase a craft perspective, like how Indigenous literature can teach writers about scene, story, and setting. The school board is minimal in its efforts, especially if it\u2019s a specified, compartmentalized, finite amount of time during which you\u2019ll be exposed to an Indigenous lens.EnvironmentIndigenous Artists Tell Us What They Think About Land AcknowledgementsGraham Isador08.09.19We also have to craft lessons to the sensibilities of a young person. I have a son who is 14 and I understand the power of exposing him to a Native author in his own curriculum\u2014he\u2019d be really happy with that. He\u2019s currently reading typical texts like To Kill a Mockingbird. These are dated books that are supposed to teach you something about race. If my son were to read something like Indian Horse, he would feel represented and he\u2019d learn something about Canadian Indigenous history.These across-the-board measures remind me of when I was at school and teachers would say we have to tolerate each other. I felt like an initiative instead of a person. We can always do more.'Let\u2019s have a balanced curriculum that includes Indigenous voices'David Robertson, The Evolution of Alice, Norway House Cree Nation, ManitobaImage courtesy of David Robertson.It strikes me as odd that we are replacing literature at a Grade 11 level with Indigenous literature, but we are presumably leaving the curriculum as it is in Grades 9, 10, and 12. There\u2019s value in integrating Indigenous literature into the curriculum at all levels. I\u2019m not saying let\u2019s replace all literature, but let\u2019s have a balanced curriculum that includes Indigenous voices in all grades.AdvertisementBut I know enough teachers to know they are trying their best. Any movement towards integrating Indigenous literature into the curriculum is positive, considering these things were never taught as early as 15 to 20 years ago. A school board reaches a number of future leaders\u2014children\u2014and can expose them to literature that teaches about Indigenous peoples and history and values. Schools really need to take that seriously. We all have our roles and in the end, what we need to be doing is listening to stories, sharing out stories, and seeing each other in stories.It\u2019s a really good time to be in this country because we have so many people telling important stories and they\u2019re all at our fingertips.

Having more mandatory Indigenous literature in the school system is important for two main reasons: educate non-Indigenous youth about the history of colonization and how those impacts are still lingering, and for Indigenous youth to see themselves represented in curriculum, particularly in the mainstream system.When I was growing up, I always knew that I was First Nations, but I never understood what that means largely due to the residential school system and the Sixties Scoop. My mom was Indigenous and she never got the opportunity to be immersed in culture, so she never got to pass that onto me. I never got to learn about that in school or in English class, and it wasn\u2019t until I became an adult that I began to discover what being Indigenous means. If I was forced by a teacher to read Indigenous literature, it might have opened up my pursuit into my identity a lot sooner.Regarding best practice, you have to engage local nations within districts. Most school districts have some sort of Indigenous education specialist or manager or principal, so engage with local nations. They\u2019ll have committees of elders and curriculum material for on-reserve schools.

The ones who have taken even a single leaf or stone suffer misfortune. Even death,\u201d warns John Starfield Myrthong\u2014referred to as just Starfield by his friends\u2014almost philosophically as he takes me through the sacred forest of Mawphlang village, a major tourist attraction in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. Said to be protected by a deity named Labasa, this sacred grove is known for its tales of punishment, trees with human-like faces and a \u2018strange magnetic pull\u2019.AdvertisementShort and athletic, Starfield is a local guide from Mawphlang, loved by his friends and elders of his village. And yet, he is unlike any other tour guide I have come across. With a gift of the gab and a distinct\u2014albeit familiar\u2014boyish charm, Starfield is just 22 with the wisdom of a nonagenarian, and a demeanour that appears straight out of a boisterous movie role. He is also a fourth-standard dropout, a circumstance that was shaped by limited financial resources\u2014something many young boys go through in the state where the trend has accelerated over the last four years.However, Starfield refused to let this define his life.As a kid, John Starfield would accompany tourists for free just to sharpen his English language.Six years ago, the only English words this boy knew were \u201chello\u201d, \u201cwelcome\u201d, \u201ccome here\u201d and \u201cbye bye\u201d. This was before one of his friends gave him a DVD of Home Alone, the movie that initiated Starfield into Hollywood. Soon, he was binge-watching Hollywood movies, downloading the subtitles, and practising accents with the sole purpose of learning English.For Starfield, learning English means a better status in society, earning respect of the villagers and, of course, furthering his career as a tour guide, a profession that requires for him to interact with at least five visitors every day. \u201cFor most boys my age, the only options are farming, getting a government job like the police forces, or becoming a tour guide,\u201d he tells me. Rising unemployment and migration of youth to cities such as Guwahati and Shillong is a major issue that is affecting the state\u2019s politics. The government has expressed concerns about decreasing employability due to reasons such as lack of industrialisation, the small service sector, and an under-developed agricultural landscape.AdvertisementStarfield\u2019s foray into the English language also comes from his love for war and action films such as Hitman, Rocky and Rambo. His favourite film, though, is Titanic. \u201cI think it has a very interesting story of struggle and love. It stars my favourite actress Kate Winslet. I don\u2019t like [Leonardo] DiCaprio that much,\u201d says Starfield whose heart beats for action stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Jackie Chan. His favourite genre is boxing. \u201cI used to do boxing at one point,\u201d he tells me.As a boy, Starfield would guide the tourists without fee to hone this new-found language skill. \u201cI was well-known as the kid who talks a lot. Some gave me a packet of biscuit for accompanying them, while a few others would give a little money. I never asked for it,\u201d he says. He would try to talk to every new person who came to Mawphlang, from tourists to truck drivers (from whom he picked up some Hindi). Now an experienced tour guide, Starfield is fluent in English, Hindi and a bit of Bengali, earning up to \u20b910,000-\u20b912,000 per month, \u201cmore than many who completed school\u201d.How green is my valley: Starfield draws his wisdom from the mountains and forests he grew up in.Becoming a tour guide was not his dream. Starfield wanted to become a cop or a marathon runner. In 2012, he won a championship of marathon, which he thought would help him get into the police force. \u201cI was counting on someone I knew who knew a minister, the way to get such a job, but was disqualified at the interview level,\u201d says Starfield, who was asked for a bribe to get ahead, but he couldn\u2019t afford it. Almost every young boy in his village wants to get a government job, he adds. \u201cThat is the only ticket to a respectable life. The only rich people here are the government officials,\u201d he says.As Starfield\u2019s life plays out\u2014one trek at a time\u2014the glue that holds it all together is the slow, comfortable life of Mawphlang, away from the \u201cselfish and political\u201d city life. \u201cWe eat good food here, breathe clean air and diseases are rare. The only ones who die early are the ones who drink too much rice beer. Even some drunkards live well into the 90s,\u201d he says. Starfield never completed his studies, but he urges other kids to contribute to the village. \u201cI want to teach kids from poor families how to earn money their own way. A lot of young boys come to me to learn Hindi and English. I help as much as I can,\u201d he says.Starfield\u2014who claims to have accompanied Bollywood personalities such as Farah Khan for treks\u2014ultimately draws his wisdom from the mountains and forests he grew up in. \u201cOur life is much more difficult than the ones who live in the plains, but it also teaches us.

The park\u2019s robotic hosts, haunted by shadowy memories that hint at their past lives and deaths, learn to follow these recollective landmarks out of the conceptual maze of their programming.For Maeve Millay (Thandie Newton), these dreams manifest as idyllic memories of her young daughter, and then take a horrific turn when the child is abducted by a member of the park\u2019s indigenous Ghost Nation. It\u2019s Maeve\u2019s worst nightmare, which is why it was so gut-wrenching to see it come true in the June 3 episode \"Les \u00c9corch\u00e9s.\"AdvertisementBut in \u201cKiksuya,\u201d which aired Sunday night, Maeve comes to realize that this long-dreaded kidnapping is an act of grace\u2014a rescue. The secret behind her epiphany? Her newfound fluency in all the park\u2019s languages. With this development, the show has established that unlocking multilingualism is not only a potent superpower for hosts, it could also be their greatest unifier against the human tourists.Indeed, \u201cKiksuya\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cremember\u201d in Lakota\u2014is the second example of Westworld making a deliberate choice to advance the plot largely through non-English dialog (the first being \u201cAkane no Mai,\u201d a Japanese language episode set in Shogun World).\u201cKiksuya\u201d unflinchingly allows Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon)\u2014the spectre of Maeve\u2019s nightmares\u2014to divulge his story in Lakota to Maeve\u2019s daughter. As a plot device, this means that the Man in Black (Ed Harris), who lies nearby riddled with bullet holes, cannot eavesdrop on the tale. But more importantly, it alludes to the enormous significance of freely speaking one\u2019s language of heritage.This is an especially poignant point for American indigenous peoples, who suffered generations of forced linguistic assimilation in residential boarding schools. To lose a language is to lose identity, and Westworld seems to have been building on this premise, which dovetails with its central themes, across several episodes.Indeed, for Aketcheta to recall his past in Lakota is itself a sign of his deliverance from Westworld\u2019s predestined script. His anchor is the memory of the sweet nothings he exchanged with his lover Kohana. She once told him: \u201cMi cante ki yu ha ya ye\u201d (\u201cTake my heart when you go\u201d). As implied by the name of the episode, he does not forget, and it\u2019s this memory that leads him out of his own cognitive maze.AdvertisementThe phrase returns to close the episode in a beautiful twist that confirms Akecheta is using Lakota to commune directly with Maeve. He knows that even as she lies bloodied and ravaged on a gurney at the Mesa Hub, she can hear and decipher his intentions to safeguard her daughter. Maeve\u2019s fearful memories of him, informed by race-based prejudices that are coded into the park, evaporate when she hears his version of events in his own tongue. \u201cMi cante ki yu ha ya ye,\u201d she responds to him.Read More: If Rich People Are the Variables in \u2018Westworld,\u2019 No Wonder the Experiment SucksThis powerful kicker adds new dimensions to Maeve\u2019s encounter with her Japanese counterpart Akane, who is forced to witness the murder of her own daughter figure, Sakura. Akane literally removes Sakura\u2019s heart as part of her funeral rites, taking it with her as she goes. The parallel implies that fluency in many languages is a signifier of a growing heartfelt connection between hosts. It\u2019s a welcome sentimental layer to a show that is often more fixated on the cerebral.Plus, it\u2019s refreshing as a viewer to be exposed to new languages, especially in light of the rise of language militancy in English-speaking countries. The recent viral video of lawyer Aaron Schlossberg harassing restaurant workers for speaking Spanish underscores a broad upswing in language policing in American culture, and demonstrates how intimidating the sound of foreign words can apparently be for some people.This is especially troubling because research has correlated multilingualism with greater cognitive abilities, capacity for tolerance, and economic benefits, compared to monolingualism. In real life, as in Westworld, immersion in multiple languages\u2014or even just basic respect for those who speak them\u2014is a reliable route through the maze of a rigid worldview.Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/59qjed/how-westworld-uses-multilingualism-to-explore-prejudice", "title": "How \u2018Westworld\u2019 Uses Multilingualism to Explore Prejudice"}, {"authors": "VICE Staff", "date_publish": "2018-02-28T04:14:56.302Z", "description": "VICE explores Southeast Asia's hidden cities", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "Vice", "maintext": "VICE explores Southeast Asia's hidden cities", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvengw/hidden-cities-singapore", "title": "Hidden Cities: Singapore"}, {"authors": "VICE Staff", "date_publish": "2018-02-28T04:05:25.984Z", "description": "VICE explores Southeast Asia's hidden cities", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "Vice", "maintext": "VICE explores Southeast Asia's hidden cities", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywqeaw/hidden-cities-kuala-lumpur", "title": "Hidden Cities: Kuala Lumpur"}, {"authors": "Drew Schwartz", "date_publish": "2017-11-28T19:11:00.000Z", "description": "In high school, it's not uncommon for teachers to subject their students to new and innovative ways of learning, like showing that cat intestines can be used to jump rope, for instance", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "Vice", "maintext": "In high school, it's not uncommon for teachers to subject their students to new and innovative ways of learning, like showing that cat intestines can be used to jump rope, for instance. But last week, some students witnessed their teacher doing something disturbing when they caught her doing drugs in her classroom during the middle of a school day, the Chicago Tribune reports.Last Wednesday, junior Will Rogers noticed his English teacher, Samantha Cox, 24, was up to something strange in the corner of her classroom. As teens are wont to do, he pulled out his phone and started filming, recording her through the window of the locked classroom door. The footage shows Cox pushing what looks like white powder into lines on a book, then bending over to snort it off her desk.Advertisement\"She\u2019s in the corner, hiding with a chair and a book and what appears to be cocaine, putting it into lines,\u201d Rogers told Chicago's WGN-TV. \"When I actually watched the footage again and again and I just realized that my English teacher just did cocaine.\"And because teens today are apparently very anti-drug, a few students who saw what went down told administrators at Lake Central High School, who then called the cops. Police then brought down a drug-sniffing dog to Cox's room and found \"a clear tightly twisted bag with multiple small rolled up pieces of tin foil' and \"a rolled up small piece of paper,\" which they said could be \"used to ingest illegal narcotics through one\u2019s nostril,\" the Tribune reports.The cops arrested Cox and marched her out of the school in handcuffs while at least one student filmed the whole thing on Snapchat. Investigators found a range of other drug paraphernalia in her car, including a glass pipe and two more paper straws, the Tribune reports.According to CBS Chicago, Cox admitted to bringing coke into the school in an interview with police, telling investigators she'd bought $160 worth of \"dope cocaine\" from her dealer that morning and snuck it into her empty classroom during a break\u2014minutes before Rogers started filming.Lake Central schools Superintendent Larry Veracco said he was happy the incident was dealt with swiftly\u2014but that at the end of the day, the whole fiasco is a pretty major bummer.\"She was popular with the students,\" Veracco told the Northwest Indiana Times. \"It's a sad situation. We are happy that we got her removed from the classroom very quickly after being tipped off by a student. But we are also concerned about her welfare, too. She seemed to be a very good teacher.\"Cox now faces charges of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a police statement, which adds her to the growing list of teachers caught doing messed-up shit at school.Follow Drew Schwartz on Twitter.", "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/59yneq/a-bunch-of-teens-snitched-on-their-teacher-for-doing-drugs-in-class-vgtrn", "title": "A Bunch of Teens Snitched on Their Teacher for Doing Drugs in Class"}, {"authors": "The George Stockton-on-Tees", "date_publish": "2017-09-25T23:00:00.000Z", "description": "Servings: 1-2 Prep time: 10 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesIngredients1 \u00bd cups|355 ml whole milk6 tablespoons unsalted butter3 \u00bd tablespoons all-purpose flour1 bay leafspices of choice (for a classic b\u00e9chamel, use \u00bd teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg)\u00bd teaspoon dried mixed herbs1 boneless skinless chicken breast\u00bd cup plain breadcrumbs1 cup grated cheddar cheeseDirectionsTo make the b\u00e9chamel sauce, warm milk in a small saucepan on low heat until just below boiling", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "Vice", "maintext": "Servings: 1-2 Prep time: 10 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesIngredients1 \u00bd cups|355 ml whole milk6 tablespoons unsalted butter3 \u00bd tablespoons all-purpose flour1 bay leafspices of choice (for a classic b\u00e9chamel, use \u00bd teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg)\u00bd teaspoon dried mixed herbs1 boneless skinless chicken breast\u00bd cup plain breadcrumbs1 cup grated cheddar cheeseDirectionsTo make the b\u00e9chamel sauce, warm milk in a small saucepan on low heat until just below boiling.

The practice dates back thousands of yearsand is traditionally seen as a meditative exercise and vehicle for contemplation. Manchester-based artist Andy Elliott says he experiences a similar therapeutic sensation when he creates his bonsai tree sculptures using strands of wire. Elliott first started making bonsai sculptures as a hobby and has slowly perfected the craft over time. Last year he started what turned out to be a successful Kickstarter campaign to help raise money for materials. He has since then undertook a second larger campaign, taking commissions and putting work up on his Etsy page.AdvertisementElliott is a prolific craftsman and has developed a significant following on his YouTube channel, where he posts videos on how to make things like an LED illusion mirror or a miniature grapple gun. His sculptures are based off a bonsai shape but also imagine a tree that is sliced in half so you can see the details of the branches inside. Each tree is a made from a number of strands of wire. Using jigs, pliers, and an array of other tools, Elliott twists the wire into tiny loops to create bunches of leaves. Elliott says some of his largest trees can use up hundreds of meters worth of wire and take up to a week to complete.

It's the kind of migration that feels like it should be narrated by David Attenborough and says a lot about the role that tribalism is able to play in a country where supporters are routinely confronted with journeys that make the trek from Plymouth to Carlisle in England\u2014at 389 miles, the longest away day in English soccer at present\u2014look like a hungover traipse to the store.AdvertisementIt's interesting to consider the value of ritual and tradition in a soccer nation that tends to draw for novelty to sustain attention. In the last few years, it's not just been soccer players and coaches that the MLS has imported; a way of supporting a lifestyle and culture of devotion has been shipped in, too, most obviously from the Premier League and Bundesliga. But really it's impossible to talk about the state of North American fandom without first\u2014what's the right word? Absorbing? Experiencing?\u2014enduring this video:Now that that's out of the way, we can get on with answering the pressing question at hand: Just why do Americans love bicycle kicks so much?~The 1994 World Cup was held in the United States. It was the first international tournament I can (just about) remember, and by virtue of me being a kid and the witching hour kick-off times, I had to watch all the games in secret on a shit TV in my room, face pressed right up against the screen with the volume on 1 so I could hear if the stairs creaked. My house was built by idiots and creaked of its own accord often, and after every false alarm, I'd have to creep back to the TV, turn it on again, and manually retune the channel because none of the preset buttons worked. But it was all worth it: Gheorghe Hagi's absurd lob against Colombia, Kennet Andersson doing the same to Brazil, Jack Charlton\u2014who, you'd think, if you've ever seen him blast the head off a stag with a shotgun, would be ecstatic just to be in a country with such lax gun control laws\u2014having a tantrum in the Orlando heat, the iridescent kits gleaming like brand-new colors in the sun, the world's saddest ponytail, the world's most obviously drugged-up genius\u2014the whole world of soccer, basically, gloriously England-free, on parade before me for the first time in my furtive satellite town panopticon.AdvertisementIt was a tournament of so many moments, proto-gifs that seemed to lodge themselves in the consciousness of a generation. But there was one moment from that tournament which, for obvious reasons, appears to have taken on a greater resonance to Americans in particular. And it's this\u2026[daily_motion src='//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x31fjgf?start=50' width='560' height='315']Chicagoan defender Marcelo Balboa, attempting to score direct from a corner with a bicycle kick.Why does any of this matter? The relationship that the US has with the bicycle kick is emblematic of its relationship to the game as a whole. Balboa failed, obviously, but that's not the point. The extent to which Americans have struggled to love soccer due to its chaotic, freeform nature, its attritional, low-scoring routes to victory, defeat or parity has often been overstated, but while the tide seems to slowly be turning amid a sea of stats-crazed Yanks getting into the game, it's still difficult to escape the feeling that its popularity would increase relative to other American sports if only it could be a little more cinematic\u2014if it were something that took place in short, scripted bursts, and had a more obvious plot line than any that could be offered up by 22 players relentlessly shifting in and out of position with very little downtime to analyze and draw breath in between. I've often found it difficult, too, to get my head around the way that so many of the players in the NFL in particular seem to fade into oblivion after a few rare seconds in the spotlight, in a way that supporting cast members like Martin Kelly or Christian Kabasele or Mohammed Elneny just can't in soccer, given the way the game is built and flows.AdvertisementBut a bicycle kick\u2014well, a bicycle kick is probably the most un-soccer thing in soccer. There is something intrinsically staged and showbiz about it\u2014so it's no surprise that, for Americans, a bicycle kick direct from a corner in a home World Cup by a man with a funny mustache, a mullet, and a fictional Hollywood boxer's name is about as relatable as it gets, even if he missed. In this second of glorious, sunlit failure, Balboa defines America's relationship to soccer. And if you think that's a stretch, listen to these commentators react to a bicycle kick scored just this season by itinerant Italian carthorse Amauri, from all of six yards. Pray they never whack the words \"Trevor Sinclair Barnsley\" into YouTube; you doubt they'd survive it.~Which brings us back, all the way back, to this man: Robby Branom. Branom is a strange dude with a loud job, an unfortunate combination for someone who doesn't seem to know where or who he is. He is, in a strictly biographical sense, a pretty pleasant-seeming white American guy who, according to the internet wormhole over my shoulder, got a solid degree and works at an energy company. He is a pretty pleasant-seeming white American guy who once got married, but crucially he is both all of this and someone who, in his spare time, goes down to the CenturyLink Field and functions as a \"capo\" for his beloved Seattle Sounders, leading his fellow fans in chants that he devised, he says, after the trips he makes to Europe \"just about every summer\u2026 I've learned the trade, you know? How it really works.\"AdvertisementI'm not sure which European summer league Mr. Branom has been watching. I'm not sure to what extent this really \"works\":I'm not saying that Americans aren't allowed to care about their soccer team. That would be absurd and especially cold-hearted given the circumstances\u2014Seattle's appearance in the MLS Cup final will be the first in their history, and I will be thinking of Branom on Saturday, hoping that a man who has watched his side through years of relative mediocrity is entirely excited, hopeful, and proud of his team, that he is exhilarated by the rare prospect of his love for Seattle Sounders being requited by success. But where it starts to get jarring for me is the naked, misplaced Anglophilia. I can't get past it. His personality in the video below seems like a dentist's waiting room of bad English stereotypes: Austin Powers, Dr. Who, Willy Fog, Neville Longbottom, Klamer the pretentious community college student, Hugh Grant, Gandalf, Shit Break\u2014they're all here, talking like Alex Jones's impression of a British person, dressed like a rugby fan:When I try to pinpoint why Robby Branom makes me feel uncomfortable, I can think of lots of reasons. Perhaps it's because, like so many depressing forces at work in this country at the minute, he represents a yearning for an England that never really existed. Perhaps it's because his own childlike and apparently cynicism-free love for the game puts the desperate, angst-ridden seething I feel twice a week into sharp and unflattering relief. But perhaps it's just because it looks like a lot of unnecessary work trying so hard to be someone else. It feels like he's turned his persona into an apology for America's lack of soccer tribalism, made himself a screaming totem to his own internal neuroses about whether or not MLS fans are doing fandom in the \"correct\" way. He makes me feel uneasy in the same way that actors in \"immersive theater experiences\" do\u2014you wanna grab his face and shake him around, tell him that it's OK, that he doesn't have to pretend anymore.AdvertisementFans of Toronto FC, the Sounders' opponents in Sunday's cup final, have a history of making themselves look like dickheads, too, most famously in the video below, where they launch into an impassioned chant of \"the referee's a wanker\":Crucially, the game had yet to kick off, which means that rather than this being a targeted, ad hominem assault on whoever officiated it, the Toronto fans must have been railing instead against the abstract concept of the referee, the notion of some independent adjudicator imposing the laws of the sport rather than allowing it to descend into a free-for-all with no set laws, objective, beginning or end, a hallucinogenic scrimmage in a pit of mud, blood, and shit that reaches out into eternity until it ceases to resemble a game at all and becomes a piece of performance art comparable in scale with global warming or modernism as one of humanity's grand historical projects. This, in fairness, sounds like a laugh, but it doesn't quite sit right coming from the mouths of North Americans\u2014people who, as I've already argued at length, tend to prefer a bit more structure to their hobbies.The apex of all this imported partisanship has arrived, unquestionably, in the fresh rivalry between New York Red Bulls and New York City FC, a hatred that nobody's calling the \"Hudson River Derby.\" To give them their due, fans of the two clubs have shown they possess a flair for nomenclature\u2014Red Bulls groups include the Garden State Ultras and the Viking Army Supporters Club, and they sit in designated parts of the Red Bull Arena known collectively as the \"South Ward.\" The first official NYCFC fan group calls itself the\" Third Rail\" after the steel conductor rail that electrifies the city's subway system. These are all decent uses of words. Which only makes it all the more weird that, when fans of the two clubs had an underwhelming quarrel in New Jersey last August, they couldn't get a three-syllable chant right:AdvertisementAlso, it was outside a place proudly claiming to be \"Newark's first gastro pub\":A battleground only outdone in irony levels by this Hard Rock Cafe:Again, certain questions are raised, chiefly: What exactly is this rivalry\u2014between a team bankrolled by an energy drink and another formed in 2015\u2014built on? And is it really a loathing so deep-set that it's worth testing the patience of a load of American police officers, when American police officers carry guns, which are deadly weapons that those officers haven't exactly proven themselves shy of using?And this is the crux, really, it is the terrace culture of English soccer that MLS fans are most clearly aping, and yet there are things about English football that you just can't ape. For example, you could argue that at the height of its infamy, English hooliganism was fueled by a poisonous cocktail of dying industry, regional resentment, mass unemployment, racial tension, a war on class loyalty, cruel government, corrupt policing, and fading empire. And you could argue that American hooliganism is fueled by the mostly fictional account of a hobbit getting beaten up at a West Ham match. The two aren't really comparable, though that didn't stop these NYCFC fans\u2014supporters of a team, remember, that was formed last year, bankrolled by Abu Dhabi oil money\u2014throwing their weight behind the anti-corporate, anti-petrodollar \"Against Modern Soccer\" movement:Despite our absence from the tournament itself, the World Cup that took place in the States in 1994 was in many ways a watershed moment for English soccer. It was the last World Cup before the Premier League and Sky had really taken off, the last World Cup before anyone here knew anything about leagues overseas beyond the fact that Gabriel Batistuta could hit a ball very hard, the last World Cup before Championship Manager and the internet and the importing of foreign players and coaches exploded, the last World Cup before we as a country, for better or worse, lost our soccer innocence, our ability to arrive every two years at an international tournament and not know the names on the shirts, the styles of play, the biographies beyond the funny haircuts. My overriding memories of USA '94 are of surprise and identity\u2014teams that arrived as mysteries and left as distinct entities I still remember vividly to this day, an unusual number of whom were led by charismatic, dictatorial number 10s: Hagi, Stoichkov, Maradona, Baggio, Valderrama, Rai, Dahlin, Matthaus, Okocha, Scifo, Bergkamp. There was an absence of the familiarity and homogeneity that can sometimes spoil things today\u2014which is why it feels a bit depressing to witness Americans attempting to ape English terrace culture.Not that I wish Robby Branom anything but the best of luck in Sunday's game. I hope that Seattle wins and that this first taste of glory helps him see that culture is something built from the ground up\u2014out of memory, loyalty, and time. And what would make me really happy is if Seattle's winning goal is a bicycle kick, scored directly from a corner, by a man with a funny mustache, a mullet, and a fictional Hollywood boxer's name.

While few people doubt the value of a post-secondary education, it's also probably true that in practical terms, not all degrees are created equal. A business administration degree, for example, would generally be considered more handy when it comes to applying for jobs than a degree is semiotics (whatever the hell that entails).AdvertisementOn top of that, university tuition has gone up 40 percent in the last decade, according to Statistics Canada. If you're gonna be saddled with a bunch of student debt, you eventually want to be able to earn enough of an income to pay it off.

It certainly helped me clarify the questions I had about life and helped me realize that there are many other people out there asking these questions. But it didn't answer the questions; I still felt confused, just less alone, perhaps.Hmm so what were your biggest questions that you hoped to answer?\nI suppose: \"Why does all this exist?\" and \"What, if anything, am I supposed to do while I exist?\"Read more: Debt, Depression, and Dud Degrees: Why Would Anyone Go to University?Speaking of, were you ever worried about how you would incorporate your degree into the real world?Well, not as much as I should have been. My parents kept warning me about that.What were they saying? Did they pay for your education?\nThey seemed simultaneously happy that I was studying something I was interested in and worried because they knew how poor the job prospects were. They'd say things like \"what are you going to do when you finish?\" and \"you'd better start thinking about getting some skills.\" And yes, they had invested in something since I was quite young, so while I did work during university I also did not have to take any loans.AdvertisementSo what did you end up doing?\nAfter I finished philosophy I moved back to Vancouver and worked at Chapters. There seemed to be a lot of people there who had degrees in the liberal arts and who were doing retail. But eventually I did more university and got into a field at McGill, they had a two-year social work program, so I got into that and have been working in the mental health field for the last eight years.

And when I got close to graduating I still had no idea what I was going to do after high school. I wanted to take a gap year but my dad wasn't super keen on the idea, and he would be paying for my post-secondary as per my parents' divorce settlement. Then my high school dance teacher suggested I pursue dance at the college level.Were you happy?\nAt university, no. I loved it in college, thrived even. But at university I felt lost. And I really just kept going because I was already halfway to a degree, this piece of paper that I was supposed to have.AdvertisementHow did you feel after you got your degree?\nMeh. It was super uneventful. I didn't even go to my convocation. I found university to be impersonal and cold and kind of pointless. Or maybe just no one explained to me how to do it properly. Like how to pick classes and professors that were inspiring and good.Where'd you end up after?\nI taught dance and worked at Lululemon and saved money to travel to South America. And I did some choreography and other performing. About two years after I got my degree I went to Langara College as a \"mature\" student for journalism. I was 25. I think I realized my degree\u2014and not just mine but most people's\u2014was basically worth nothing from an employment standpoint.Kinda nuts that you can get a degree in this tbh. Photo via Flickr user alyssa.becker Knowing what you know now about degrees vs diplomas, college vs university, would you do anything differently?\nNo. I think part of me is a bit sad that I didn't get as much out of university as I could have, because I am super privileged to have been able to go, and have my parents pay for it. I do wish I had pushed harder for a gap year to figure out what I was interested in. And to be a little older. Seventeen is so young to be in that environment and if I hadn't gone to college first I would have drowned in it. Even at 20 I found it overwhelming. Universities to some degree kind of function like daycares for young adults we don't know what else to do with.Jesse S., 37\nComparative Religions, minor in near and middle eastern civilizations, University of TorontoAdvertisementSo your undergrad sounds fairly .. unique. Why were you interested in that?\nI was just following my passions at the time. My uncle is a well-recognized biblical scholar so there was some influence there, even if he never recognized my undergrad efforts. I was, and still am, interested in what makes people tick, and how we see the world around us. I also secretly wanted the degree so I could start a cult. I never got around to it but, at least I'm qualified.What kind of cult?\nWell, it would be a benevolent one, not the malignant kind that takes advantage of followers and requires that they give up all their funds and material possessions to the leader of the group.So like the pastafarians?\nSure.While you were studying did you ever worry about how the stuff you were learning would translate into the real world?\nNo, not really. I was surrounded by thousands of others of humanities students with not very practical degrees. We were all in it together. Strength in numbers right?And you were enjoying what you were doing?\nYes, I still value academia. While I came to my sense towards the end of my undergrad and realized that going to study Buddhism on the beach in Hawaii for a master program, (or retreating to live in the caves with Saddhus in India, a boyhood fantasy at the time, which I may revisit one day) may not be the most practical use of my time, my thirst for knowledge is realDid you pay for your own schooling?\nNo.AdvertisementWhat are you doing now?\nI'm currently working as a digital marketing specialist with a focus on social media. In the past I was an arts/culture/lifestyle journalist.So not really anything related to your degree\nIt was a cultural degree. I work in culture. It's loosely based on it.Graham Reeder, 25\nHuman ecology, College of the AtlanticWhat even is human ecology?\nMy diploma may as well have just said: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary self designed degree, so I was mostly drawn to the idea of taking liberal arts to the extreme, of fundamentally taking control of my educational trajectory by designing my own course of study.Sounds interesting, did you enjoy it?\nYeah I loved it. It could get frustrating at times, there were people there who just took a bunch of intro classes and fucked around for four years and got an indistinguishable degree from me which sometimes felt unfair, but I made peace with that. The motivation of knowing that I had to make myself employable on different terms forced me to get off my ass and do cool things, which I did, and ended up with a far more impressive resume at the end of four years than most poli sci undergrads from universities with name recognition.So you felt like by the time you got your degree you were prepped for the workforce?\nYes and no, I think I had a solid set of skills for the workforce but lacked some of the plush connections that people I know who went to bigger universities had. So I was ready to work but struggled to find it.AdvertisementCollege of the Atlantic looks pretty lit. Photo via Facebook Did you pay for school?\nI guess that was a large factor as well. I had a full scholarship for all four years there. I was thinking of going to U of T, I had an entrance scholarship and a millennium scholarship, but it was still gonna be too much because of cost of living and the fact that I didn't have much saved up or a wealthy family to support me.What are you doing these days?\nWell, I went back to grad school last year, mostly because I knew the stuff I was doing wasn't what I wanted to do my whole life. I'm studying urban planning at the faculty of environmental studies at York University and my degree will be in environmental studies, so once again another pretty useless on paper degree. Apparently it's a habit for me.Do you have a particular career in mind? Would you want to be a planner?\nNot in a formal sense, I'd like to be a policy advisor for cities and urban regions planning for climate change impacts\u2014a job that doesn't really exist yet in most places, but will as time goes on. Kinda weird banking one's career on our collective failure to stop climate change, but here we are.James W., 38\nEnglish literature and film studies (double major), University of TorontoHow did you settle on that double major?\nIt just kind of happened. I'd finished high school, had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, so I signed up for everything. Art history, a biology course, Spanish. At some point I think I had Anglo Saxon in there. Like the dead language. Film and english were the two that stuck. I'm not sure Anglo Saxon would have been significantly less useful.AdvertisementDid you enjoy it while you were doing it? Film and english\u2014not Anglo Saxon\nFor sure. They were things I was interested in. To be clear: I didn't learn to make movies. I learned to watch movies. As in: how is the T-800 really Jesus? In what ways is Marilyn Monroe really just a giant talking penis? That kind of thing.Read more: We Spoke to Students About the Weirdest Degrees You Can Do at UniversityHonestly how did your degree translate into the real world? Did it just make you more annoying to watch movies with?\nIt made me hate smart movies. There are only so many three hour shots of melting ice cream you can watch before you kind of get your fill. Job wise it wasn't a huge asset. I went back to do my masters in journalism. That actually came in pretty handy.Interesting. Journalism is pretty frequently cited on those most useless degrees lists\u2014how did it work out for you?\nI got in before newspapers went extinct. I did an internship, got a job, later started a company. It's still useful when I want to make people believe I can write.Did you pay for school?\nYeah. Jobs plus scholarships. I actually came out of undergrad $3,000 ahead. Free ride to U of T, including money for room and board. It was a pretty sweet deal.Nice, so even though you had kind of a frivolous degree, you wouldn't do anything differently?\nIt's definitely easier to have a degree than not to have a degree. Or at least some kind of post secondary. I have a friend who stopped at a high school diploma. He's in his late 30's, he's smart, has a ton of work experience and useful skills, and the lack of letters still gives him grief. But if I could do it over again I'd probably do something useful like law or medicine. Would have made my life a lot easier. BAs are straight up stupid.

Jacobs of St. Maarten, as well as former Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand.\u00a0Recent global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate emergency and conflicts, have shown the positive difference women\u2019s leadership and decision-making can make in executive positions, parliaments, and public administration. \u00a0For example, data from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Women, shows that governments with higher women\u2019s representation in parliaments adopted a higher number of gender-sensitive policy measures in response to the pandemic, including policies aimed directly at strengthening women\u2019s economic security.\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s event was hosted by the Office of the President of the UN General Assembly and UN Women, in cooperation with the Council of Women World Leaders (CWWL).\u00a0In his remarks to the gathering, General Assembly President Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si made the case for having more women in government.\u00a0\u201cWomen\u2019s leadership is transformative. The women leaders with us today are living proof of this fact,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cInclusive governance can result in policies that create positive change over the long term. By integrating the views of diverse women \u2013 especially at the highest levels \u2013 governments can effectively tailor and target solutions to those most in need.\u201d\u00a0Out of the 193 countries that are UN Member States, only 28 women serve as elected Heads of State or Government. \u00a0There also is still a long way to go when it comes to the proportion of women in other levels of political office. \u00a0\u00a0Globally, women comprise 21 per cent of the world\u2019s ministers, 26 per cent of national parliamentarians, and 34 per cent of elected local government seats. \u00a0\u00a0A new UN report has further revealed that at the current pace of progress, equal parliamentary representation will not be achieved until 2062.\u00a0Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women, sees a strong role for the newly created leadership platform.\u00a0\u201cWhen more women lead in political and public life, everyone benefits, especially in crises,\u201d she said.\u201cA new generation of girls see a possible future for themselves. Health, education, childcare, and violence against women, receive greater attention and better solutions. We must find every possible way to amplify the assets women leaders bring. This Platform is an opportunity to do just that.\u201d\u00a0The UNGA Global Platform of Women Leaders has its genesis in a September 2021 meeting between women Heads of State and Government and Abdulla Shahid, who was President of the General Assembly at the time.\u00a0Mr. Shahid underscored the importance of Tuesday\u2019s event, given the statistics. \u00a0\u201cAt our current rate of progress, it could take 300 years to achieve gender equality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must act now. Accelerate investment in girls and women. Scale up efforts to empower women. Expand opportunities for girls. Eliminate gender-based violence.\u201d \u00a0The UNGA Platform of Women leaders will also help bring visibility to women in prominent political leadership positions, according to the event\u2019s organizers.\u00a0The critical role of women\u2019s leadership in driving sustainable development is well documented, they added. \u00a0Countries with greater numbers of women political leaders tend to give greater attention to issues such as health, education, infrastructure, and ending violence against women. \u00a0In response to the pandemic, women leaders championed policies that addressed its social and economic impacts on the most vulnerable groups. \u00a0Data also shows that in conflict-affected contexts, women\u2019s representation in public life brings heightened credibility to peace processes and negotiations, helping unify divided communities. \u00a0Furthermore, research has also shown that seeing more women in power\u00a0increases girls\u2019 educational and career aspirations.\u00a0\u201cIt is my strong belief that the world needs more women leaders and more diverse leaders, people with all kinds of backgrounds and life experiences,\u201d said Ms. Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland and the CWWL Chair.\u00a0\u201cThe decisions leaders make affect all people in our societies.

It is the first time in more than a decade that the Sudan strain has been found in Uganda, which also saw an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus in 2019.The latest outbreak follows six suspicious deaths in Mubende district so far this month. There are also eight suspected cases who are receiving care in a health facility.Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa, said that the UN agency was working closely with Ugandan authorities to investigate the source, and support efforts to control it.\u201cUganda is no stranger to effective Ebola control\u201d, she said. \u201cThanks to its expertise, action has been taken to quickly to detect the virus and we can bank on this knowledge to halt the spread of infections.\u201d Existing vaccines against Ebola have proved effective against the Zaire strain but it is not clear if they will be as successful against the Sudan strain, WHO said in a statement.Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. It has six different strains, three of which - Bundibugyo, Sudan and Zaire - have previously caused large outbreaks. Case fatality rates of the Sudan strain have varied from 41 per cent to 100 per cent in past outbreaks. Early roll-out of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola, WHO said.The agency has dispatched supplies to support the care of patients and is sending a specialized tent that will be used to isolate patients. While ring vaccination of high-risk people with Ervebo (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine has been highly effective in controlling the spread of Ebola in recent outbreaks in DRC and elsewhere, said WHO, this vaccine has only been approved to protect against the Zaire strain.Another vaccine produced by pharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson may be effective but has yet to be specifically tested against the Sudan strain.Ebola has resurfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) following confirmation of a case in the restive eastern province of North Kivu, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Tuesday, citing authorities in the country.\u00a0The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for countries to improve access to two lifesaving Ebola medicines, in its first guidelines on the viral disease, published on Friday.\u00a0", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/story/2022/09/1127181", "title": "Rare Ebola outbreak declared in Uganda "}, {"authors": "\u00a9 UNICEF/Asad Zaidi", "date_publish": "20 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubMillions of people in Pakistan are still deeply affected by catastrophic flooding which \u201cis not going anywhere\u201d, UN relief agencies said on Tuesday", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubMillions of people in Pakistan are still deeply affected by catastrophic flooding which \u201cis not going anywhere\u201d, UN relief agencies said on Tuesday.Close to eight million people have been displaced by the disaster and the UN along with the authorities and partners have continued to race to reach affected populations with desperately needed relief items.\u201cIn #Pakistan\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 are some 7.6 million people have now been displaced by the floods, with nearly 600,000 living in relief sites.\" -- @Refugees\u201cWe have very severe malaria, people are getting fits because of cerebral malaria, there is no medicine & no shelter.\" -- @UNICEF_Pakistan pic.twitter.com/FIT58s563RSouthern Sindh province is still in crisis, with many areas still under water.To date, more than 1,500 people have been killed, including 552 children.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough food, we don\u2019t have shelter, and still even the kind of healthcare that is required is not available,\u201d said Gerida Birukila, UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Pakistan Chief of Field Office in Balochistan, another of the worst-hit provinces.In a fresh appeal for international support, the UNICEF worker described desperate scenes. \u201cRoads and bridges have been washed away; I\u2019ve just come from the field and the water is not going anywhere,\u201d Ms. Birukila\u00a0 continued, speaking via Zoom from Quetta.

Where would any of us be?\u201d, he asked those gathered in the iconic Generally Assembly Hall.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s simple: Education systems today simply don\u2019t make the grade.At the #TransformingEducation Summit, I urged world leaders to find & support solutions to ensure everyone can learn, thrive & dream throughout their lives. pic.twitter.com/gv6lMBK5IIBecause education transforms lives, economies and societies, \u201cwe must transform education\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of being the great enabler, the UN chief pointed out that education is fast becoming \u201ca great divider\u201d, noting that some 70 per cent of 10-year-olds in poor countries are unable to read and are \u201cbarely learning\u201d.\u00a0With access to the best resources, schools and universities, the rich get the best jobs, while the poor \u2013 especially girls \u2013 displaced people, and students with disabilities, face huge obstacles to getting the qualifications that could change their lives, he continued.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, COVID-19 has \u201cdealt a hammer blow to progress on SDG4\u201d, the Sustainable Development Goal targeting equitable quality education.\u00a0\u201cBut the education crisis began long before \u2013 and runs much deeper\u201d, Mr Guterres added, citing the International Commission on the Future of Education report card, which clearly stated: \u201cEducation systems don\u2019t make the grade\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Dependent upon outdated and narrow curricula, under-trained and underpaid teachers, and rote learning, he maintained that \u201ceducation is failing students and societies\u201d.At the same time, the digital divide penalizes poor students as the education financing gap \u201cyawns wider than ever\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNow is the time to transform education systems\u201d, underscored the UN chief.With a new 21st century education vision taking shape, he flagged that quality learning must support the development of the individual learner throughout their life.\u201cIt must help people learn how to learn, with a focus on problem-solving and collaboration\u2026provide the foundations for learning, from reading, writing and mathematics to scientific, digital, social and emotional skills\u2026develop students\u2019 capacity to adapt to the rapidly changing world of work\u2026[and] be accessible to all from the earliest stages and throughout their lives\u201d.At a time of rampant misinformation, climate denial and attacks on human rights, Mr. Guterres stressed the need for education systems that \u201cdistinguish fact from conspiracy, instill respect for science, and celebrate humanity in all its diversity\u201d.To make the vision a reality, he highlighted five commitment areas beginning with protecting the right to quality education for everyone, everywhere \u2013 especially girls and those in crisis hotspots.Emphasizing that schools must be open to all, without discrimination, he appealed to the Taliban in Afghanistan: \u201cLift all restrictions on girls\u2019 access to secondary education immediately\u201d.As \u201cthe lifeblood of education systems,\u201d Mr. Guterres next called for a new focus on the roles and skillsets of teachers to facilitate and promote learning rather than merely transmitting answers.Third, he advocated for schools to become \u201csafe, healthy spaces, with no place for violence, stigma or intimidation\u201d.To achieve the fourth target, that the digital revolution benefits all learners, he encouraged governments to work with private sector partners to boost digital learning content.This is what war does to children\u2019s education.   At today\u2019s #TransformingEducation Summit, @UNICEF is calling on governments to scale up support to help every child learn, wherever they are.   #LetMeLearn #UNGA pic.twitter.com/a1fAjOk5O1\u201cNone of this will be possible without a surge in education financing and global solidarity\u201d, said the UN chief, introducing his final priority.He urged countries to protect education budgets and funnel education spending into learning resources. \u00a0\u201cEducation financing must be the number one priority for Governments. It is the single most important investment any country can make in its people and its future,\u201d spelled out the Secretary-General. \u201cSpending and policy advice should be aligned with delivering quality education for all\u201d.In closing, he stated that the Transforming Education Summit will only achieve its global goals by mobilizing \u201ca global movement\u201d.\u201cLet\u2019s move forward together, so that everyone can learn, thrive and dream throughout their lives. Let\u2019s make sure today\u2019s learners and future generations can access the education they need, to create a more sustainable, inclusive, just and peaceful world for all\u201d.Catherine Russell, who heads the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) drew attention to the effect of war on children\u2019s education, calling on governments to \u201cscale up support to help every child learn, wherever they are\u201d.Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS, highlighted the devastating impact of HIV on adolescent girls and young women in Africa, informing the participants that in sub-Saharan Africa last year, 4,000 girls had been infected every week.\u201cThis is a crisis!\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when a girl is infected at that early age, there\u2019s no cure for HIV, that marks the rest of their lives, their opportunities\u201d.She told the summit that 12 African countries have now committed to Education Plus, a bold initiative to prevent HIV infections through free universal, quality secondary education for all girls and boys in Africa, reinforced through comprehensive empowerment programmes.Audrey Azoulay, leader of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reminded that \u201cthere can be no economic development and no peace without education,\u201d and underscored that Afghan girls must be able to go back to school. \u201cIt is their right\u201d, she upheld. Watch here deliver her address here.Other distinguished speakers included UN Messenger of Peace Malala Yousafzai who called on world leaders to make schools safe for girls and protect every child's right to learn, saying that \u201cif you are serious about creating a safe and sustainable future for children, then be serious about education\u201d.Somaya Faruqi, former Captain of the Afghan Girls Robotics Team avowed that every girl has a right to learn, asserting that \u201cwhile our cousins and brothers sit in classrooms, me and many other girls are forced to put our dreams on hold. Every girl belongs in school\u201d.Newly announced UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Vanessa Nakate, stressed the need to for all children to have access to education, as \u201ctheir future depends on it\u201d. Watch her address here.Another highlight was a stirring musical performance by UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Angelique Kidjo, who encouraged everyone to raise their voice for transforming education.Later in the afternoon, it was announced that more than 130 countries attending the summit, have committed to rebooting their education systems and accelerating action to end the learning crisis\u00a0The commitments came after 115 national consultations that brought together leaders, teachers, students, civil society and other partners to gather collective recommendations on the most urgent asks. Nearly half of the countries prioritized measures to address\u00a0\u200blearning loss, while a third of countries committed to supporting the psycho-social well-being of both students and teachers.\u200b Two in three countries\u00a0\u200balso referenced measures to offset the direct and indirect costs of education for\u200b economically vulnerable communities, and 75% of countries underlined the importance of\u00a0\u200bgender-sensitive education policies in their commitments. These statements underscored the role of education in achieving all the SDGs and linkages with the climate crises, conflict and poverty. Measures addressed COVID-19 recovery and getting back on track on the SDGs, while emphasizing the need for innovations in education to prepare the learners of today for a rapidly changing world.The UN Secretary-General and the President of the 77TH General Assembly joined world leaders and Goodwill Ambassadors on Monday in a global call to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and get back on track to building a better world that \u201cleaves no one behind\u201d.Education systems around the world need \u201cmore, not less money\u201d the UN chief told journalists on Saturday during a joint press stakeout on the Transforming Education Summit and the International Finance Facility for Education.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/story/2022/09/1127011", "title": "Education transformation needed for \u2018inclusive, just and peaceful world\u2019 \u2013 UN chief"}, {"authors": "UN Photo/Mark Garten", "date_publish": "19 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubThe UN Secretary-General and the President of the 77TH General Assembly joined world leaders and Goodwill Ambassadors on Monday in a global call to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and get back on track to building a better world that \u201cleaves no one behind\u201d", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubThe UN Secretary-General and the President of the 77TH General Assembly joined world leaders and Goodwill Ambassadors on Monday in a global call to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and get back on track to building a better world that \u201cleaves no one behind\u201d.The 2022 SDG Moment, which places an annual spotlight on the 17 Global Goals agreed by countries in December 2015, took place as the world faces a deepening cost-of-living crisis against the backdrop of the Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have halted development, especially in low-income countries.\u201cThe world has a long \u2018to do\u2019 list\u201d, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told world leaders, asking for more finance and investment from the public and private sectors, to meet growing needs.Acknowledging the current \u201cmoment of great peril\u201d for our world \u2013 characterized by conflicts, climate catastrophe, division, unemployment, massive displacement and other challenges - Mr. Guterres said that although \u201cit was tempting\u201d to put long-term priorities to the side, development could not wait.\u201cThe education of our children cannot wait.

The UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described it as \u201ca critical vehicle to support resilience and prevention.\u201dBetween 2006 and 2021 the PBF allocated $1.67 billion to 65 countries to sustain peace efforts. Haiti has received around $20m for nine projects. These interventions focus broadly on implementing and sustaining peace agreements, dialogue and peaceful coexistence and re-establishing basic services that can contribute to building peaceful societies. \u00a0Instability and insecurity, propelled by stark inequalities, have been long-standing problems in Haiti and are the key reasons why the Government called for the support of the PBF.\u00a0The assassination of the Haitian president in July 2021 and a destructive earthquake in the south of the country a month later compounded the insecurity caused by the growing presence and influence of gangs.This insecurity has worsened in the capital Port-au-Prince over the past year, as gang violence, exacerbated by the proliferation of illicit weapons and ammunitions, has intensified. The number of cases of kidnapping for ransom has also escalated.\u00a0In the commune of Cite Soleil, one of the capital\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods, 99 people were killed and 133 injured during one particularly violent week of clashes in July between gangs vying for control of territory. \u00a0Hundreds of houses were destroyed and thousands of people fled to safer localities, many of whom were supported by the United Nations.\u00a0Edwin* a youth leader living in Cite Soleil and who is part of a group of young people supported by the PBF, said that he witnessed heavy fighting in the streets adding that \u201cI go to bed and wake up to the sound of gunfire which is very stressful.\u201d The group brings youth together from neighbourhoods where rival gangs are active. \u201cWe want our voices to be heard outside Cit\u00e9 Soleil, because if no-one hears us nothing will change,\u201d he said.\u00a0Gang violence is only one very tangible manifestation of insecurity and the lack of peace, but the lives of Haitians are being impacted in countless other ways. In Cite Soleil, roughly 95,000 school children in over 300 schools had their education disrupted by violence.\u00a0More than 2,500 people fled the commune and had to seek support from the UN. The blockading of roads to the south has stopped the free flow of people and services in both directions, making it difficult for farmers to get their crops to market in Port-au-Prince and for aid and reconstruction materials to be delivered to the earthquake-affected southern peninsula.\u00a0\u201cReducing violence and conflict, accessing justice and establishing lasting peace and stability are the priorities of the UN\u2019s Peacebuilding Fund,\u201d said Ulrika Richardson, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Haiti. \u201c. It is through the leadership of a broad range of local and national actors, that we envision accompanying Haiti in building a peaceful and prosperous society for all Haitians.\u201d\u00a0Without stability, security and justice, economic progress is near impossible. This is unfortunately becoming increasingly clear with the continued slow-down of the Haitian economy whose effects are most felt by the most vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities.The PBF has played a particularly important role in Haiti following the closure of the UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSTAH, in 2017. The PBF is one of the few resources available to the United Nations to scale up efforts in areas previously covered by the mission or areas requiring renewed attention.The fund has focused on a number of key areas including community violence reduction with an emphasis on supporting and promoting participation at the community level with a focus on the youth. It has also promoted social cohesion and mental health, especially for women and girls, and it is supporting activities to prevent election-related and political violence, again with a special emphasis on protecting and empowering women.\u00a0Strengthening the justice system including providing legal aid to vulnerable populations while reinforcing coordination between judicial actors and the penal system is also a PBF priority.Ultimately, the PBF is a people-centered funding mechanism, that has resulted in notable successes.\u00a0As a 15-year-old, Renel* was held in detention without trial for three years in a prison in Les Cayes after being wrongfully accused by a shopkeeper of stealing two ducks. His case drew the attention of the United Nations and was referred to a legal aid office, established by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN\u2019s political mission in Haiti, BINUH and the Haitian Ministry of Justice and Public Security and funded by PBF.\u00a0Renel, along with 67 other individuals, was released from detention. \u201cKids should be in school, not in jail,\u201d he said.Sylvie participates in a PBF-supported group in the gang-affected Martissant neighbourhood, which seeks to prevent and resolve disputes at the community level. With a focus on women\u2019s empowerment and countering sexual violence she said: \u201cthe situation may not be resolved tomorrow, but we are hopeful that we will see changes in the longer-term.\u2019\u2019International Day of Peace is observed around the world on 21 September. The 2022 theme is \"End racism. Build peace\"UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths allocated on Friday, $5 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to respond to humanitarian needs triggered by gang violence in Haiti.With Haiti\u2019s highways increasingly in the grip of gangs, aid delivery by ship is becoming increasingly critical.

The disruption in supplies pushed soaring prices even higher and contributed to a global food crisis. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the United Nations and T\u00fcrkiye, was set up to reintroduce vital food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine to the rest of the world. Here are some key points to understand.Ukraine, one of the world\u2019s largest grain exporters, normally supplies around 45 million tonnes of grain to the global market every year but, following Russia\u2019s invasion of the country, in late February 2022, mountains of grains built up in silos, with ships unable to secure safe passage to and from Ukrainian ports, and land routes unable to compensate.This contributed to a jump in the price of staple foods around the world. Combined with increases in the cost of energy, developing countries were pushed to the brink of debt default and increasing numbers of people found themselves on the brink of famine.On 22 July, the UN, the Russian Federation, T\u00fcrkiye and Ukraine agreed the Black Sea Grain Initiative, at a signing ceremony in T\u00fcrkiye's largest city, Istanbul.The deal allowed exports from Ukraine of grain, other foodstuffs, and fertilizer, including ammonia, to resume through a safe maritime humanitarian corridor from three key Ukrainian ports: Chornomorsk, Odesa, and Yuzhny/Pivdennyi, to the rest of the world.To implement the deal, a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) was established in Istanbul, comprising senior representatives from the Russian Federation, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, and the United Nations.According to procedures issued by the JCC, vessels wishing to participate in the Initiative will undergo inspection off Istanbul to ensure they are empty of cargo, then sail through the maritime humanitarian corridor to Ukrainian ports to load. The corridor is established by the JCC and monitored 24/7 to ensure the safe passage of vessels. Vessels on the return journey will also be inspected at the inspection area off Istanbul. Shipments monitored by the Initiative began leaving from 1st August. By the end of the month, over 100 ships, laden with more than one million tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs, had left Ukraine. By mid-September the JCC reported that some three million tonnes had left Ukraine, signalling positive progress. It is hoped that, eventually, up to five million tonnes will be exported monthly.According to UN figures, 51 per cent of the cargo so far (as of mid-September) has been corn, 25 per cent wheat, 11 per cent sunflower products, six per cent rapeseed, five per cent barley, one per cent soya beans, and one per cent other foodstuffs.A 25 per cent of the cargo has gone to low and lower-middle income countries. Egypt (8 per cent), India and Iran (4 per cent each), Bangladesh, Kenya and Sudan (2 per cent each), Lebanon, Yemen, Somalia, Djibouti (1 per cent each), and Tunisia (less than one per cent)This includes UN-chartered vessels delivering humanitarian food assistance \u2013 World Food Programme (WFP) purchased wheat \u2013 to the Horn of Africa and Yemen. Two UN-chartered ships have already left Ukraine, while another two are expected soon. WFP had so far purchased 120,000 metric tonnes of wheat to support humanitarian relief in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan. The first WFP-chartered vessel docked in Djibouti on 30 August to support the drought response in the Horn of Africa. A second UN-chartered vessel, loaded with 37,500 metric tons of wheat, sailed on 30 August and docked in T\u00fcrkiye on 3 September, where the wheat will be milled to flour.This flour will then be loaded onto a different ship that will head to Yemen to support the World Food Programme\u2019s humanitarian response there. The third and fourth WFP-chartered vessels will also supply wheat to relief operations.Some 25 per cent of grain has gone to upper-middle income countries \u2013 including T\u00fcrkiye, China and Bulgaria; and 50 per cent to high-income countries like Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Republic of Korea, Romania, Germany, France, Greece, Ireland, and Israel.The UN points out that all of the grain coming out of the Ukrainian ports thanks to the Initiative benefits people in need, as it helps to calm markets, and limit food price inflation.All ship movements can be found on the Black Sea Grain Initiative website, which also contains useful facts and figures.There are strong signs that the Initiative is succeeding in one of its key aims, getting food prices down. At a press briefing in mid-September, Rebeca Grynspan, the Secretary-General of the UN trade agency, known as UNCTAD, and Amir Abdulla, the UN Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative welcomed the fact prices have come down five months in a row: the Food Price Index has decreased nearly 14 per cent from its peak in March of this year.Mr. Abdulla explained that falling prices meant that those who had been hoarding grain, in the hope of selling at a greater profit, were now selling, which meant that there is now more food supply in the markets, leading to further price drops. Ms. Grynspan, who is also coordinator of the UN global Task Team set up to help support countries deal with the triple economic shocks worsened by the effects of the war in Ukraine, pointed out that this is making a huge difference in a global cost of living crisis. \u00a0Globally, a record 345 million people in more than 80 countries are currently facing acute food insecurity, while up to 50 million people in 45 countries are at risk of being pushed into famine without humanitarian support. In August, WFP Executive Director David Beasley declared getting the Black Sea Ports open to be \u201cthe single most important thing we can do right now to help the world\u2019s hungry\u201d. He warned that, whilst this would not, on its own, stop world hunger, bringing Ukrainian grain back on global markets would improve the chance of preventing the global food crisis from spiralling even furtherThe UN is acutely aware that keeping shipments sailing smoothly out of Ukrainian ports will require the continued collaboration of Ukraine and Russia. Mr. Abdulla has praised the \u201ccollaborative spirit\u201d between the parties to the Initiative. He also noted the special role that T\u00fcrkiye and the UN are playing in keeping the process moving.However, with no clear end in sight to the war, the future is uncertain. The current Initiative may extend beyond its initial 120 days after the signing date of 22 July, if parties so choose. Thoughts at the JCC team in Istanbul are already turning to the extension of the deal. Mr. Abdulla remains positive, expressing his hope that \u201cwith the UN's mediation efforts, it won't really be a matter for discussion\u201d.Reports that mass graves have been discovered in the Ukrainian city of Izyum are to be investigated by UN rights monitors, it\u2019s been announced.As risks of conflict-induced famine and widespread food insecurity continue to rise, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator urged the Security Council on Thursday to address the interlinked crises, and work towards establishing lasting peace in affected regions.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/story/2022/09/1126811", "title": "UN officials see progress as global food prices drop amid ongoing Black Sea grain deal shipments "}, {"authors": "\u00a9 UNICEF/Veronica Houser", "date_publish": "15 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubOne of the centrepieces of the opening week of the new General Assembly session is an event aimed at focusing fresh attention on the global crisis surrounding learning, and proposing solutions to make education fit for the Twenty-First Century", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubOne of the centrepieces of the opening week of the new General Assembly session is an event aimed at focusing fresh attention on the global crisis surrounding learning, and proposing solutions to make education fit for the Twenty-First Century. Ahead of the event, UN News spoke to Leonardo Garnier, the Special Advisor charged with making the Transforming Education Summit a success.Many education experts worry that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused untold damage to the education prospects of children around the world, exacerbating problems of falling standards that already existed, with millions of children receiving minimal, inadequate education, or no education at all.In the days before the Transforming Education Summit, UN News met Leonardo Garnier, an academic and former education minister in Costa Rica, who was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as Special Advisor for the Summit.He explained why going back to the old ways of teaching is not an option, and how the UN can help to bring fresh ideas to classrooms around the world and raise educational standards for children everywhere.UN News The UN is tackling so many big geopolitical issues right now, such as the climate crisis, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. Why has education been chosen as key theme this year?Leonardo Garnier It\u2019s precisely the right time to do it, because when there\u2019s an economic slowdown, what usually happens is that education goes under the table: it ceases to be a priority. Governments need money, and they stop spending on education.The problem here is that the damage this causes is only apparent after several years. If you take the Eighties education crisis, it wasn\u2019t until the Nineties and 2000s that you started to see how countries had lost out because of a lack of educational investment.Millions of children were left out of school because of the pandemic. But the pandemic also brought out what had been happening for years, because many of those who were in school were not really learning properly.UN News Talk us through the 1980s educational crisis. What happened, and what were the consequences?Leonardo Garnier What you saw in many parts of the world was stagflation, and a huge reduction in education budgets. Enrolment rates fell, teacher numbers fell, and many children missed out on education, particularly high school education.And what that meant is that, in many countries, only around half the labour force finished primary school. When you look at increasing poverty, and increasing inequality in many countries, it is very difficult not to relate that to the reduced educational opportunities of the Eighties and Nineties.UN News Do you think that what we're seeing now is going to potentially lead to a repeat of that situation?Leonardo Garnier That could happen. From 2000 to 2018 we saw increases in school enrolment rates in most countries, and in educational investment. From then on, educational budgets started to be reduced, and then the pandemic hit.And then what you have is really two years in which education stopped in many countries, alongside an economic crisis. So yes, there is a risk that, instead of recovering from the pandemic, we could be in an even worse position than we were in 2019.What the Secretary General is saying is that we have to protect education from this big hit, and recover what we lost in this pandemic. But we actually have to go further.With SDG 4 [the Sustainable Development Goal to improve access to quality education for all], the UN and global community have set themselves very ambitious targets.You might think that everybody should have the right to education but, if we keep doing things as they were being done prior to the pandemic, we won\u2019t get there.\u00a0At the Transforming Education Summit, we want to send the message that, if we really want every young person in this planet to have the right to a quality education, we have to do things differently.We have to transform schools, the way teachers teach, the way we use digital resources, and the way we finance education.UN News What is your vision for an education system that is fit for the Twenty-First Century?Leonardo Garnier It has to do with the content, with what we teach and the relevance of education.On one side, we need the fundamental building blocks of education \u2013 literacy, numeracy, scientific thinking \u2013 but we also need what some people have called the Twenty-First Century skills. Social skills, problem solving skills.Teachers need to impart knowledge by sparking curiosity, helping students to solve problems and guiding students through the learning process. But, to do that, teachers need better training, better working conditions, and better wages, because in many countries, the pay for teachers is very low.They need to understand that their authority does not come from merely having more information than their students, but from their experience and capacity to lead the learning process.In any labour activity, productivity results in part from the tools we use. When we talk about education, we've been using the same tools for around 400 years! With the digital revolution, teachers and learners could have access to much more creative tools for teaching and learning.\u00a0At the Summit, we\u2019re saying that digital resources are what economists call a public good: they require a lot of investment to be produced, and they are not cheap, but once they are produced, everybody could use them.\u00a0We want digital learning resources to be transformed into public goods, so that every country can share their own resources with other countries. For example, teachers from Argentina could share content with teachers from Spain; Egypt has a lovely digital education project that could be shared with many other Arab countries.The potential is there, but we need to bring everything together into a partnership for digital learning resources. This is something else that we are calling for at the Summit.With just a few weeks to go until the opening of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, the UN diplomatic community, as well as residents of New York City, are bracing for the annual arrival of Heads of State and Government from around the world, after two years of disruption wrought by COVID-19.

It is the largest in the Middle East \u2013 and one of the largest in the world \u2013 and home to some 80,000 Syrians. UN News spoke to some of the refugees about life at the camp, and their hopes for the future.Adil Toukan came to Za\u2019atari camp in April 2013, from the city of al-Sanamayn in the Daraa governorate in southern Syria, along with his wife and two young children.Since then, he and his wife have had three more children, who know nothing about their home country.\u00a0\u201cMy family and I went through a great deal of suffering when we left Syria. We crossed more than one security checkpoint and more than one country.\u00a0Life is stable, in terms of the living conditions, security, and infrastructure. The educational situation is excellent [There are 32 schools in the camp, 58 community centres, and eight clinics in the camp].Electricity is available for eight hours per day. There is a sewage network and a water network. There are asphalt roads and an internal transportation network.We want our children to have a better life than us, in terms of education, study and work.\"Qassim Lubbad, from Daraa governorate, came to the camp in May 2013. He is not optimistic about the situation in Syria.\u00a0\u201cSurely no one came here willingly. I came from Syria with five children and had three children here in the camp.Everyone came because they were forced to seek safety and security. There was suffering. Families took different routes. We spent more than 72 hours moving from one village to another until we reached the border and entered Jordan.\u00a0When I talk to my children about Syria, and tell them that we have family there, they ask me: What is Syria? I explain that a war broke out, and we came to the camp. I tell them that staying here in the camp is not our choice: when things calm down and the security situation improved, we will return to Syria.They ask me about their future here and whether they will complete their studies and then marry and own homes here. I answer them that this matter is not in our hands, but in the hands of God, and that just as we came without prior planning, we can also return to Syria without prior planning\".I hope that the situation will change for the better. I miss everything in Syria: the air and water, childhood, memories, parents and relatives\".More than 20,000 births have been registered in Za\u2019atari since it opened a decade ago. An entire generation of children has grown up there, and the camp has become their world.\u00a0Ten-year-old Ghina was born in Syria and came with her family to Za\u2019atari camp when she was only 6 months old.\u201cI study in the third grade. I love school here. I like mathematics and English, but my favourite subject is Arabic. My dream is to become a policewoman when I grow up, because I want to serve my people.I miss my grandparents very much. They are still in Syria. I talk to them every day, and they show me pictures of our house and tell me about the past. I am so excited to see them.\"Fourteen-year-old Muhammad came to the camp when he was only four. He says he remembers coming to the camp.I knew that we had come to the camp in search of safety and security.

Ahead of the Day, UN News spoke to two experts about the scale of the problem, and the solutions that already exist.For several years, the World Health Organization has warned that practically all the air we breathe is polluted, and that it\u2019s killing around seven million people every year: about 90 per cent of those deaths take place in low and middle-income countries.In 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 7 September as the \u201cInternational Day of Clean Air for blue skies\u201d, and stressed the urgent need to raise public awareness at all levels, and to promote and facilitate actions to improve air quality.Five years on, WHO scientists have concluded that the impact of air pollution kicks in at a much lower level than previously thought; is the international community taking the issue seriously? And, crucially, what can be done to tackle it?\u00a0To discuss the deadly issue, UN News spoke to two experts from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a grouping that is hosted by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP): \u00a0Martina Otto, head of the Secretariat, and Nathan Borgford-Parnell, Coordinator of Science Affairs.Martina Otto Air pollution has often been seen as a very local, national problem. There have been efforts by a lot of countries to bring down emissions, but definitely not at the level that is needed.\u00a0And since pollutants are travelling in the air, and often for long distances, we can't solve this by isolated measures. It's the air we share, and that means we also have to share the solutions.UN News How has the situation evolved in recent years?\u00a0Nathan Borgford-Parnell Air quality has not improved dramatically over the last decade, and the World Health Organization (WHO), using a very rigorous multi-year process, put out new ambient air quality guidelines last year, which cut the level at which fine particulate matter affects health by half (from 10 microns to five microns).UN News Low and middle-income countries are identified as being by far the worst affected regions of the world. Why is that?Nathan Borgford-Parnell The populations there have particular vulnerabilities, linked to the technologies they use for cooking, for heating their homes, for transportation, and the kind of energy that is often used.Also, there are factors related to the age of populations, and the very young and the very old are particularly vulnerable, often without means and access to healthcare.\u00a0UN News How would you evaluate the amount of cooperation that's taking place now compared to previous years?Martina Otto We\u2019ve just completed our third assessment of Africa, which brought the issue to the table of governments. We've used those regional assessments to discuss the issues, and there is appetite to start looking into that and we'll see where it takes us. But we are hopeful to see much more regional cooperation.It's no longer a blame game. It's about looking together at the solutions, which lie in cooperation. It's a sustainable development issue: the very thing that keeps all of us alive breathing makes us sick as well.\u00a0UN News The right to a clean environment was adopted by the UN General Assembly in July. Why was this important?Martina Otto Because air pollution is an issue that affects all of us, and disproportionately affects those that are most vulnerable, as Nathan explained.\u00a0There\u2019s also an economic and gender issue to this. For example, air pollution might be bad in a certain city, but the level of pollution depends very much on neighbourhoods as well, where certain industries are located, where the wind is blowing.We know that pollution is actually greater in poor neighbourhoods, so there is a real issue of environmental injustice.UN News What concerns you most about the links between climate change and air pollution?\u00a0Nathan Borgford-Parnell What concerns me is that we may not get enough people to recognize that there is no separation between air pollution and climate change.Wildfires are human driven, yet some people try to act as if they're natural occurrences. But the precipitous increase in wildfires in recent years, and the modelling that says that we're going to continue to see them increasing all over the world in places we couldn't have ever imagined them, shows us that climate change will directly impact the burden of disease from air pollution caused by the wildfires.\u00a0And air pollution impacts the climate: there are no air pollutants that do not impact the climate. None. Greenhouse gases, aerosols, pollutants, they all impact the climate. The links between air pollution and climate change are legion and increasing.However, the great benefit of the fact that these things are linked, and we can combine the climate and the air quality issues in the public health communities, and push them towards solutions that achieve benefits for all.That is the empowering message of the Climate and Clean air Coalition, and why people have been so excited to be with us for the last decade.UN News The Cop 27 UN climate conference is coming up in November. Will air pollution be an important part of the discussions there?Martina Otto There will be a number of events around the issue. I think the the message is getting home, in the sense that people can already see the impacts.We know what we need to do. There are many solutions out there that make economic sense and can get the job done. We just have to get them to scale, and put political will behind that.\u00a0For example, end the open burning of waste which allows methane to escape, and manage waste in a proper way, which is also good sense because there are economic opportunities in that process.The issue of transport as well, how we design our cities to reduce the need for transport, and make it easier to walk and cycle safely, reducing the need for fossil fuel options by looking at alternative fuels.There's a long list of solutions, but they're very concrete and they actually improve the way we live in our cities as well.You can hear the full discussion on the UN\u2019s flagship news podcast, The Lid Is On.\u00a0With 161 votes in favour, and eight abstentions*, the UN General Assembly adopted a historic resolution on Thursday, declaring access to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, a universal human right.In late July, the UN General Assembly is expected to vote on a draft resolution recognizing the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/story/2022/09/1126101", "title": "Blue sky thinking: 5 things to know about air pollution"}, {"authors": "UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe", "date_publish": "19 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubCiting a raft of global challenges \u2013 from climate change and geopolitical division to deepening inequalities and conflict \u2013 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for strengthened international solidarity to address them", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubCiting a raft of global challenges \u2013 from climate change and geopolitical division to deepening inequalities and conflict \u2013 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for strengthened international solidarity to address them.\u201cMy objective is to make it clear that \u2026we need cooperation, we need dialogue, and the present terrible geopolitical divides are not allowing it to happen.

Look out for our full in-depth interview ahead of #UNGA, covering #ClimateAction & many other topics pic.twitter.com/hcZFJ0Va9SThe UN chief is just back from a solidarity visit to flood-ravaged Pakistan, where he called repeatedly for fast \u2013 and serious \u2013 to not only end what he called \u201cclimate carnage\u201d but to provide more support for the countries that are the most-impacted but have done very little to cause the phenomenon.He told UN News: \u201cWe need to increase support to developing countries, not only in the reduction of emissions, but in building resilience, in building the sustainable infrastructure that is necessary for those countries to be able to [withstand] the impacts that are already devastating them. Most of the [climate] hotspots in the world [are] countries that did not contribute in a meaningful way to climate change.\u201dOn the geopolitical front, the Secretary-General stressed the need for more dedicated and tactful diplomacy to effect demonstrable change on tough issues, including the global food shortages that have been sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.Using the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative as an example, the UN chief said: \u201cThis has demonstrated that discreet diplomacy is still able to achieve what megaphone diplomacy does not. This agreement would not have been possible if we had not worked persistently to get it done with discretion, avoiding the creation of situations in which inevitably both parties start to fight each other.\u201dThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.UN News: You\u2019ve just returned from Pakistan where you visited areas hit by climate-related disaster. We are now alarmed at the drought and possibility of famine threatening Somalia. \u202fWhat do you want to say to those who still deny that climate change is real \u2013 do we not ignore it at our peril?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: Well, climate change is the defining issue of our time. And I\u2019m extremely worried because with the war in Ukraine and several other events, climate change seems to have moved out of the priorities for many decision makers around the world, and this is suicide. We see emissions growing and we see fossil fuels becoming fashionable again [even though] we know that fossil fuels are the main [cause] for the progressive war against nature that we have been waging throughout our history.It is absolutely essential to reduce emissions now. And unfortunately, while we should be able to reduce 45 per cent of the emissions [by] 2030, we are [instead facing] an increase in emissions [by] 14 per cent in 2030. So, we absolutely need to reverse this trend. We are heading into a catastrophic situation, and we have not much time to turn things around.And at the same time, when we look at Pakistan, the level of destruction and the area flooded is three times the [size] of my country [Portugal]. We need to increase support to developing countries, not only in the reduction of emissions, but in building resilience, in building the sustainable infrastructure necessary for those countries to be able to [withstand] the impacts that are already devastating them. Most of the [climate] hotspots in the world are countries that did not contribute in a meaningful way to climate change. UN News: Every year, we usher in a new session of the General Assembly, often seen as a highlight of the year for the United Nations. What is your focus for this year\u2019s GA, the first since the pandemic when we are meeting in person and with a major war in Europe drawing attention away from other global priorities?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: My objective is to make it clear that the geopolitical divisions we are witnessing today are terrible. When the world is facing climate change, when the world is facing the possibility of other pandemics and COVID-19 has not yet been resolved, when the world is facing high levels of inequality between developed and developing countries, and huge inequality within countries. The world needs to really turn around on all these aspects. We need unity, we need cooperation, we need dialogue, and the present geopolitical divides are not allowing it to happen. We need to change course.UN News: The war in Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest and largest refugee crises in history. Kyiv [the Ukrainian capital] was bombed while you were visiting the country. How does this crisis differ from many others that you\u2019ve seen as a High Commissioner and later as UN Secretary-General?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: Most of the crises I have witnessed are in developing countries, relatively poor countries, and most of them are internal, even if there is an intervention [by] external powers. They became civil wars or [were] terrorist activities inside the country. Now we have a war between one superpower and Ukraine, which is also a modern country. And we are talking about levels of devastation that are not possible in situations where the nature of the armaments and the military capacity are completely different. So, this is indeed once again a war between two states, created by the invasion of one state by another, with levels of armament and levels of force mobilization that are unparalleled in recent times. On the other hand, we are witnessing the fastest movement of refugees and displaced persons in recent history, with terrible humanitarian consequences.UN News: You are hosting a major gathering to look at transforming education which has suffered in so many countries. You are keen to find responses to the economic slowdown that has seen a massive decline in progress with sustainable development. Amid major geopolitical tensions, what is your best-case scenario to make progress on these fronts?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: If I had to choose one thing to improve the world situation [and] peace and security, that thing would be education. If I had to choose one thing to improve the capacity of understanding of climate change and the response to climate change, that would be education. When I look to anything that could reduce inequalities in the world, that thing would be education. But unfortunately, we are seeing, with the dramatic situation that we have in the world today \u2013 the war on climate, pandemics \u2013 we are seeing education budgets being reduced.And so, the summit on [transforming] education is a moment to mobilize the whole international community to make countries understand that they need to invest much more in education, and to make developed countries understand that they need to amplify, together with international financial institutions, the support to developing countries for them to be able to invest in education.We have launched the International Finance Facility for Education with Gordon Brown, and my hope is that this facility will be quickly funded by all donors in order to really make a difference for the most vulnerable populations in the world.UN News: The Black Sea Grain Initiative has already seen almost three million tonnes of food from Ukraine leave for destinations across the world, helping alleviate the food crisis and saving lives. What are some of the essential components of this success story? How optimistic are you that this formula could be applied to other complicated situations?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: This has demonstrated that discreet diplomacy is still able to achieve what megaphone diplomacy does not. This agreement would not have been possible if we had not worked persistently to get it done with discretion, avoiding the creation of situations in which inevitably both parties start to push back against each other. And this is, I would say, the recipe for many of the crises in the world. Let\u2019s do everything possible to reestablish the importance of discreet diplomacy in crisis solution in today\u2019s world.UN News: Human rights are one of the pillars of the UN\u2019s work. You have flagged the dangers posed by rising hate speech, xenophobia and populist nationalism. \u202fWhy is this happening, and what \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 gives you hope?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: Well, these things have always existed, but they are now immensely amplified by social media and by all the [information technology] platforms that exist around the world.On the other hand, when countries have difficulties in solving their problems, nationalism, xenophobia, making scapegoats, and [targeting] foreigners are unfortunately some of the things that are becoming more and more frequent. We need to understand that human rights must unite \u2013 unite communities, unite countries. Racism and xenophobia are two absolutely unacceptable manifestations of hatred that we need to... eliminate in our world.UN News: For a long time, you have been expressing concerns over the reality that the world becoming more polarized, what you\u2019ve called the \u2018great fracture\u2019. As Secretary General, it is obvious that this political reality makes your job more difficult. What can you do to bring the world together?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: I do not have the power to make miracles. What we can do is to be determined to use as much as possible the instruments at our disposal \u2013 good offices, mediation \u2013 and do everything we can to make the world understand that the enormous challenges that we face can only be addressed with solidarity, cooperation and unity.UN News: This time last year, COVID-19 seemed to be the biggest global crisis we were all living through, impacting the General Assembly and the UN\u2019s operations. What should governments and the UN be doing to keep public health high on the agenda?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: It is very important to solve the problems of [equitable distribution and availability of vaccines] where those problems still exist. This is something that the UN system is mobilizing behind. And second, it is absolutely essential to provide the countries that were impacted by COVID-19 \u2013 by the lockdowns, by the end of tourism, by many other aspects, and are today in a desperate situation, in a perfect storm, without fiscal space, with increased debt \u2013 mechanisms of debt relief, to have mechanisms of provision of liquidity to the developing countries that are more [stressed], including middle income countries, in order for them to be able to recover.When we saw that the richer countries were able to print billions or even trillions to relaunch their economies, unfortunately, developing countries could not do the same... their currencies would, of course, go down the drain. So, international solidarity must be reestablished.UN News: As you have begun your second term, how do you feel you would like to make the UN fit for purpose? What is the biggest reform you would like to see happen if you had your way?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: We have launched Our Common Agenda, which is a series of projects, of ideas, of proposals, whose objective is to make the UN much more effective, and at the same time to reestablish multilateralism as the way to solve the world\u2019s problems. My main objective is to [have] Our Common Agenda developed and adopted by Member States and to transform itself into the main instrument we have supporting the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to be able to bring more peace, more development, more justice and the effective respect of human rights to the world.UN News: Given your emphasis on gender parity and engaging youth, what will you do to ensure your legacy in this respect? Do you want to see a young female successor?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: First of all, we have reached parity in relation to senior management of the UN, about 200 senior leaders. We have parity in the Resident Coordinators, which means the coordinators of the UN activities in the different countries of the world. And we are moving toward the objective of reaching parity in 2028 at all levels of the work of the United Nations.On the other hand, we have been mainstreaming gender into all policies of the UN, into all the actions of all agencies, and in all the work that we do. About the Secretary-General, I'm sorry. I'm not a woman.

The Taliban must let them back in.Echoing Mr. Guterrres\u2019s call, the UN Mission there repeated its demand for the ban to be overturned immediately.Markus Potzel, acting head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), described the anniversary on Sunday as \u201ca tragic, shameful, and entirely avoidable\u201d development.The ongoing exclusion of girls from secondary school classes \u201chas no credible justification and has no parallel anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Potzel said.He added that the decision \u2013 taken soon after Taliban fighters rapidly overran Kabul last August - had been \u201cprofoundly damaging to a generation of girls and to the future of Afghanistan\u201d.When Afghanistan\u2019s high schools reopened to boys on 18 September last year, the newly installed Taliban rulers issued an order for girls aged 12 to 18, to remain at home, impacting grades seven to 12. It\u2019s estimated that more than one million girls have been barred from attending high school lessons over the past year, despite international condemnation and promises from the authorities that the situation would be remedied.\u201cThe UN yet again calls upon the Taliban to reverse the slew of measures they have introduced restricting Afghan women and girls\u2019 enjoyment of their basic rights and freedoms,\u201d said Mr. Potzel, who is also the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan.\u201cThe window of opportunity may be narrowing, but we urge them to take concrete steps \u2013 such as actively enabling girls to return to high school \u2013 that can lift Afghanistan up and give hope to its people.\u201dThe Afghan expert and veteran diplomat \u2013 who recently served as Ambassador of Germany to Afghanistan \u2013 insisted that the onus was on the Taliban \u201cto create favourable conditions for peace, inclusion, security, human rights and economic recovery\u201d.And he added that the international community \u201cremains ready\u201d to support a government represented \u201call its people and respects their rights\u201d.Humanitarians have stayed and delivered in Afghanistan in the year since the Taliban takeover, and it is imperative that the international community continues to do the same while the de facto authorities must also do their part, the Security Council heard on Monday.\u00a0Mahbouba Seraj, one of the world\u2019s most prominent women\u2019s rights activists, chose to stay in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in August 2021, to witness what was happening to her country, and to work for a society that benefits all of its people.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/story/2022/09/1126991", "title": "Afghanistan: UN repeats call for Taliban to allow girls full access to school"}, {"authors": "UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe", "date_publish": "19 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubCiting a raft of global challenges \u2013 from climate change and geopolitical division to deepening inequalities and conflict \u2013 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for strengthened international solidarity to address them", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubCiting a raft of global challenges \u2013 from climate change and geopolitical division to deepening inequalities and conflict \u2013 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for strengthened international solidarity to address them.\u201cMy objective is to make it clear that \u2026we need cooperation, we need dialogue, and the present terrible geopolitical divides are not allowing it to happen. We need to change course,\u201d Mr. Guterres said in a wide-ranging interview with UN News ahead of the General Assembly\u2019s annual high-level week.In our in-depth UN News interview with @antonioguterres he says some key decision-makers are downgrading the #ClimateCrisis as a priority issue - a suicidal decision. Look out for our full in-depth interview ahead of #UNGA, covering #ClimateAction & many other topics pic.twitter.com/hcZFJ0Va9SThe UN chief is just back from a solidarity visit to flood-ravaged Pakistan, where he called repeatedly for fast \u2013 and serious \u2013 to not only end what he called \u201cclimate carnage\u201d but to provide more support for the countries that are the most-impacted but have done very little to cause the phenomenon.He told UN News: \u201cWe need to increase support to developing countries, not only in the reduction of emissions, but in building resilience, in building the sustainable infrastructure that is necessary for those countries to be able to [withstand] the impacts that are already devastating them. Most of the [climate] hotspots in the world [are] countries that did not contribute in a meaningful way to climate change.\u201dOn the geopolitical front, the Secretary-General stressed the need for more dedicated and tactful diplomacy to effect demonstrable change on tough issues, including the global food shortages that have been sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.Using the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative as an example, the UN chief said: \u201cThis has demonstrated that discreet diplomacy is still able to achieve what megaphone diplomacy does not. This agreement would not have been possible if we had not worked persistently to get it done with discretion, avoiding the creation of situations in which inevitably both parties start to fight each other.\u201dThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.UN News: You\u2019ve just returned from Pakistan where you visited areas hit by climate-related disaster. We are now alarmed at the drought and possibility of famine threatening Somalia. \u202fWhat do you want to say to those who still deny that climate change is real \u2013 do we not ignore it at our peril?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: Well, climate change is the defining issue of our time. And I\u2019m extremely worried because with the war in Ukraine and several other events, climate change seems to have moved out of the priorities for many decision makers around the world, and this is suicide. We see emissions growing and we see fossil fuels becoming fashionable again [even though] we know that fossil fuels are the main [cause] for the progressive war against nature that we have been waging throughout our history.It is absolutely essential to reduce emissions now. And unfortunately, while we should be able to reduce 45 per cent of the emissions [by] 2030, we are [instead facing] an increase in emissions [by] 14 per cent in 2030. So, we absolutely need to reverse this trend. We are heading into a catastrophic situation, and we have not much time to turn things around.And at the same time, when we look at Pakistan, the level of destruction and the area flooded is three times the [size] of my country [Portugal]. We need to increase support to developing countries, not only in the reduction of emissions, but in building resilience, in building the sustainable infrastructure necessary for those countries to be able to [withstand] the impacts that are already devastating them. Most of the [climate] hotspots in the world are countries that did not contribute in a meaningful way to climate change. UN News: Every year, we usher in a new session of the General Assembly, often seen as a highlight of the year for the United Nations. What is your focus for this year\u2019s GA, the first since the pandemic when we are meeting in person and with a major war in Europe drawing attention away from other global priorities?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: My objective is to make it clear that the geopolitical divisions we are witnessing today are terrible. When the world is facing climate change, when the world is facing the possibility of other pandemics and COVID-19 has not yet been resolved, when the world is facing high levels of inequality between developed and developing countries, and huge inequality within countries. The world needs to really turn around on all these aspects. We need unity, we need cooperation, we need dialogue, and the present geopolitical divides are not allowing it to happen. We need to change course.UN News: The war in Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest and largest refugee crises in history. Kyiv [the Ukrainian capital] was bombed while you were visiting the country. How does this crisis differ from many others that you\u2019ve seen as a High Commissioner and later as UN Secretary-General?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: Most of the crises I have witnessed are in developing countries, relatively poor countries, and most of them are internal, even if there is an intervention [by] external powers. They became civil wars or [were] terrorist activities inside the country. Now we have a war between one superpower and Ukraine, which is also a modern country. And we are talking about levels of devastation that are not possible in situations where the nature of the armaments and the military capacity are completely different. So, this is indeed once again a war between two states, created by the invasion of one state by another, with levels of armament and levels of force mobilization that are unparalleled in recent times. On the other hand, we are witnessing the fastest movement of refugees and displaced persons in recent history, with terrible humanitarian consequences.UN News: You are hosting a major gathering to look at transforming education which has suffered in so many countries. You are keen to find responses to the economic slowdown that has seen a massive decline in progress with sustainable development. Amid major geopolitical tensions, what is your best-case scenario to make progress on these fronts?Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres: If I had to choose one thing to improve the world situation [and] peace and security, that thing would be education. If I had to choose one thing to improve the capacity of understanding of climate change and the response to climate change, that would be education. When I look to anything that could reduce inequalities in the world, that thing would be education. But unfortunately, we are seeing, with the dramatic situation that we have in the world today \u2013 the war on climate, pandemics \u2013 we are seeing education budgets being reduced.And so, the summit on [transforming] education is a moment to mobilize the whole international community to make countries understand that they need to invest much more in education, and to make developed countries understand that they need to amplify, together with international financial institutions, the support to developing countries for them to be able to invest in education.We have launched the International Finance Facility for Education with Gordon Brown, and my hope is that this facility will be quickly funded by all donors in order to really make a difference for the most vulnerable populations in the world.UN News: The Black Sea Grain Initiative has already seen almost three million tonnes of food from Ukraine leave for destinations across the world, helping alleviate the food crisis and saving lives. What are some of the essential components of this success story? How optimistic are you that this formula could be applied to other complicated situations?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: This has demonstrated that discreet diplomacy is still able to achieve what megaphone diplomacy does not. This agreement would not have been possible if we had not worked persistently to get it done with discretion, avoiding the creation of situations in which inevitably both parties start to push back against each other. And this is, I would say, the recipe for many of the crises in the world. Let\u2019s do everything possible to reestablish the importance of discreet diplomacy in crisis solution in today\u2019s world.UN News: Human rights are one of the pillars of the UN\u2019s work. You have flagged the dangers posed by rising hate speech, xenophobia and populist nationalism. \u202fWhy is this happening, and what \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 gives you hope?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: Well, these things have always existed, but they are now immensely amplified by social media and by all the [information technology] platforms that exist around the world.On the other hand, when countries have difficulties in solving their problems, nationalism, xenophobia, making scapegoats, and [targeting] foreigners are unfortunately some of the things that are becoming more and more frequent. We need to understand that human rights must unite \u2013 unite communities, unite countries. Racism and xenophobia are two absolutely unacceptable manifestations of hatred that we need to... eliminate in our world.UN News: For a long time, you have been expressing concerns over the reality that the world becoming more polarized, what you\u2019ve called the \u2018great fracture\u2019. As Secretary General, it is obvious that this political reality makes your job more difficult. What can you do to bring the world together?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: I do not have the power to make miracles. What we can do is to be determined to use as much as possible the instruments at our disposal \u2013 good offices, mediation \u2013 and do everything we can to make the world understand that the enormous challenges that we face can only be addressed with solidarity, cooperation and unity.UN News: This time last year, COVID-19 seemed to be the biggest global crisis we were all living through, impacting the General Assembly and the UN\u2019s operations. What should governments and the UN be doing to keep public health high on the agenda?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: It is very important to solve the problems of [equitable distribution and availability of vaccines] where those problems still exist. This is something that the UN system is mobilizing behind. And second, it is absolutely essential to provide the countries that were impacted by COVID-19 \u2013 by the lockdowns, by the end of tourism, by many other aspects, and are today in a desperate situation, in a perfect storm, without fiscal space, with increased debt \u2013 mechanisms of debt relief, to have mechanisms of provision of liquidity to the developing countries that are more [stressed], including middle income countries, in order for them to be able to recover.When we saw that the richer countries were able to print billions or even trillions to relaunch their economies, unfortunately, developing countries could not do the same... their currencies would, of course, go down the drain. So, international solidarity must be reestablished.UN News: As you have begun your second term, how do you feel you would like to make the UN fit for purpose? What is the biggest reform you would like to see happen if you had your way?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: We have launched Our Common Agenda, which is a series of projects, of ideas, of proposals, whose objective is to make the UN much more effective, and at the same time to reestablish multilateralism as the way to solve the world\u2019s problems. My main objective is to [have] Our Common Agenda developed and adopted by Member States and to transform itself into the main instrument we have supporting the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to be able to bring more peace, more development, more justice and the effective respect of human rights to the world.UN News: Given your emphasis on gender parity and engaging youth, what will you do to ensure your legacy in this respect? Do you want to see a young female successor?Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: First of all, we have reached parity in relation to senior management of the UN, about 200 senior leaders. We have parity in the Resident Coordinators, which means the coordinators of the UN activities in the different countries of the world. And we are moving toward the objective of reaching parity in 2028 at all levels of the work of the United Nations.On the other hand, we have been mainstreaming gender into all policies of the UN, into all the actions of all agencies, and in all the work that we do. About the Secretary-General, I'm sorry. I'm not a woman. But I of course, see, with a lot of interest and sympathy, the possibility to have women not only as Secretary-General of the United Nations, but as leaders of the most [influential] countries in the world.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/interview/2022/09/1127021", "title": "INTERVIEW: Guterres calls for course correction to end geopolitical divisions, tackle climate crisis"}, {"authors": "UN Photo/Evan Schneider", "date_publish": "16 September 2022", "description": "SubscribeAudio HubThe incoming President of the UN General Assembly, Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si, has said that the world is suffering mightily from a lack of trust, and while planning to do all he can to move the needle forward on a host of global challenges \u2013 from the climate crisis to the war in Ukraine and food shortages \u2013 he will also use his mandate leading the UN\u2019s most representative body to help restore trust among nations and strengthen confidence in the international system", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "OnuNews", "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubThe incoming President of the UN General Assembly, Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si, has said that the world is suffering mightily from a lack of trust, and while planning to do all he can to move the needle forward on a host of global challenges \u2013 from the climate crisis to the war in Ukraine and food shortages \u2013 he will also use his mandate leading the UN\u2019s most representative body to help restore trust among nations and strengthen confidence in the international system.\u201cWe are in a very dire situation [regarding the need to build trust].

No formalities [just] investigating what are the facts [of particular situations] on the ground. I think it can build a bit of trust.\u201dThe new Assembly President also told UN News that the theme for the body\u2019s 77th session, would be \u2018solutions through solidarity sustainability and science\u2019, aiming specifically to enhance the role of science in the UN body\u2019s decision shaping.\u201cMember States are struggling with declining trust [and] division. Our task is to find solutions based on evidence; solid evidence that can help us move forward. Science can provide science-based evidence, Mr. K\u0151r\u00f6si said, stressing; \u201cWe are not asking scientists to tell us what to do. We are asking scientists to show us the options and to show us what might be the consequences of our actions or inaction. Science should be invited as a \u2018supporter\u2019, but ultimate political decision making remains with the Member States.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.UN News: Every new General Assembly session begins with a symbolic handover of the famous gavel from the outgoing to the incoming President. How heavy, metaphorically speaking, does the gavel feel to you? What do you think will be the most important decisions and resolutions approved with a strike of this gavel during your presidency during the Assembly's 77th session?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: The physical weight of this gavel is very, very modest. Despite the divine origin of this object. But the political and spiritual weight that it carries will be much more because the world is in a very complex crisis.The UN is reflecting the affairs out there. The UN is as divided today as the world is out there. So, what we must do is basically try to solve some of the big issues that divide us. This means crisis management and the UN is supposed to help Member States to look forward. It means transformation. All those big decisions that may come through the lenses of crisis management and transformation will come under the gavel.UN News: Mr. President, you have suggested solutions through solidarity sustainability and science as the theme for the new session of the Assembly. While solidarity and sustainability are more familiar, science seems to be a new component to the formula. How do you plan to introduce this into the work of the GA during the session?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: If you don't mind, I would like to touch upon all the forests, not only because they are a nice metaphor or nice alliteration of all letters.Solutions. Because we have so many treaties, so many agreements, so many goals, so many targets, and action plans. But we are much weaker on implementation, and it is time for implementation. It is a time not only for more actions but for more transformative actions.Solidarity. The inequalities [have been] growing in the world for many, many years, within countries and among countries. And if we let those inequalities grow infinitely, it would inevitably lead to more frictions, more tensions, more conflicts and more crises. We have to do something about it. And the most important [way is by] honoring our commitments \u2013 commitments within our countries and among all countries in the international [arena]. If we let communities down, the whole world will suffer. Let us not forget: we stand or fall together.Sustainability. This is about transformation. It's about responsibility. It's about looking forward. What kind of world are we going to have today? Tomorrow? What kind of world are we going to leave for our children and grandchildren? And the responsibility is here and now. Sustainability means that we take integrated views on very complex issues.\u00a0UN News: How does science fortify all those efforts?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si:\u00a0Member States are struggling with declining trust, divisions among States [and] among communities. And of course, it will be very difficult to look for ideological solutions. And that\u2019s not our task. Our task is to find solutions based on evidence; solid evidence that can help us move forward. Science can provide science-based evidence.But it is very important to understand: we are not asking scientists to tell us what to do. We are asking scientists to show us the options and to show us what might be the consequences of our actions or inaction. Science should be invited as a help. Science should be invited as a \u2018supporter\u2019, but ultimate political decision making remains with the Member States.UN News: So, you plan to draw on the experience of the UN system in general, like the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations, as well as external groups, the global community. Is that right?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: Yes, indeed. We would like to resort to the knowledge and advice of the UN agencies who are working very deeply and who are involved very deeply in science. But it may not be enough at this time around. We would like to build and conduct regular consultations with science-based institutions, with faith-based institutions, with business communities, financial institutions to advise us on how they would approach the very complicated questions that are coming up on the agenda of the Member States. And not only to having a sounding board, but to make sure that their suggestions, their advice could and should reach the Member States.\u00a0We also would like to convene a regular consultation process. Earlier, it was called \u2018morning consultations\u2019 and \u2018morning coffees\u2019 or \u2018morning dialog\u2019, with smaller group of members, of ambassadors in a very relaxed, very informal environment. [These talks would aim] to see what advice is put forward by the science community, or the business community, what the interests of the Member States are, what are the facts on the ground\u2026 and what can we do together. [That would be a discussion] without any obligation. So, it's a bit [like] preparing the decision-making process that would take place in the GA.UN News: Speaking of solutions, when talking to the media after being sworn in, while answering a question about Ukraine, you said war cannot bring prosperity, it can only bring suffering and that [this] war must be stopped. How do you plan to utilize your offices to find the solution and help achieve this goal, both during the upcoming high-level week and beyond?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: Thank you for mentioning it. I think the aggression [against Ukraine], as it was described in a resolution of the General Assembly, was a turning point in the thinking of many countries. A very large majority of the Member States have spoken up on this issue. They understood that we are at the threshold of a new era in history.This war, this aggression, brought suffering to millions in Ukraine, in Russia, in the neighboring countries, and actually to many other nations thousands of miles away from the conflict zone through the\u00a0 disruption of food chains, food supplies, energy supplies, by [driving] up inflation rates to levels which were unprecedented in the last few decades. It introduced a general uncertainty and mistrust. And most importantly, it started decomposing the system of cooperation built on trust and agreements. So, we have to rebuild it. I'm not naive. I'm not suggesting that it be done within one year. But we have not a single day to lose. Because suffering must be alleviated.Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach suffering people. The open threats to the [global security architecture] should be curtailed as soon as possible. Therefore, I\u2019m asking all of us to work for an urgent ceasefire. And to make sure that human suffering is alleviated.And in concrete terms of what you have asked, the 11th emergency session of the General Assembly is [ongoing]. It can be reconvened at any time if Member States ask for it. Upon the request of Member States, based on the circumstances, it can be convened within 24 hours. And I'm ready to do so.Find out more here about special emergency sessions of the General Assembly.\u00a0UN News: You mentioned that there are many uncertainties in the world, and besides conflicts, there are other crises. Climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, to name just a few. On different occasions you mentioned the water crisis. You have sounded the alarm about that. Are you going to keep this topic high on your agenda during the 77th session?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: Yes, very much so! Because it is probably the next major challenge we are going to face.Actually, this challenge has already [begun]. Look at Pakistan. Look at the huge droughts across continents. We have basically three types of problems with the water: too little water, too much water or water [that is polluted]. And [many] countries are suffering from all three at the same time, in different regions. It is a complex problem that can bring down sustainable development. It is capable of undoing progress made on many, many fronts \u2013 from poverty eradication to food security, energy production and economic transformation.It's a very complex issue with bearing on political lives. It has security, human dimensions [and] economic dimensions, and [touches on] the general state of our environment. It\u2019s a central issue. And it [has now been] almost 50 years since the UN convened its first full-fledged conference on water \u2026 since 1977. [The upcoming UN Water Conference] will give an opportunity to the Member States to [take] transformative steps.We know what the problems are. The problems have been enumerated many, many times. Now it\u2019s time for solutions. It\u2019s time [for] transformative solutions.UN News: Speaking of unity\u2026 As part of your [mandate] as President of the General Assembly, you are expected to assist delegates to reach consensus and by extension to unite the world. What will you and your office do to build trust and reestablish the spirit of cooperation between countries?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si:\u00a0If the question were whether I could do miracles, whether I could solve all the big issues within one year, then, of course, the answer would be \u2018It\u2019s not realistic!\u2019 But as I mentioned earlier, we have no time to lose, not a single day. We are in a very dire situation. On building trust...we have to acknowledge that the UN is a mirror of the general [state of] the world. But the UN also has another feature. It has always had another feature. It has shown solutions. It shown opportunities. And I think that should be seized. Those opportunities are there for building trust among actors here, in this chamber.As I mentioned, I plan to organize on a regular basis, very open, hopefully very interesting and inspiring informal consultations on very difficult issues. Let\u2019s imagine 20 ambassadors sitting around almost a \u2018fireside\u2019, discussing issues that may have a direct bearing on the deliberations in the General Assembly. No formalities, no records. Investigating what are the facts on the ground, what is the scientific evidence that could be taken into consideration and what might be concerns of certain countries? I think it can build a bit of trust.\u00a0\u00a0And I think it also can build a bit of trust if we listen to those who are outside of this chamber \u2013 many, many millions of people who are expecting the United Nations to deliver.It's their hope. It\u2019s their hope for this institution, for this Organization. They have needs. They have knowledge [and] experience on the ground.I hope to have consultations with [civil society or non-UN] organizations to give them the opportunity to inform Member States. I think it's always good to be on the same page, to have the same information, to listen to the same sources. So, it's important, of course, that those sources should come from all corners of the world.\u00a0UN News: Mr. President, would you also use the information and the insight of multiple sources when discussing the matter of revitalizing the UN and the General Assembly, an issue citied in the Vision Statement for your presidency? And would this also be the approach that you're going to pursue when, for instance, discussing Security Council reform?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: Yes, very much so, though the licenses of the PGA are rather different when we talk about the General Assembly\u2019s affairs and the Security Council\u2019s affairs. But let\u2019s acknowledge: the world is changing. The realities in the world by changing. The complexity of the challenges we are facing is changing. So must our Organization. So must our institutions. Institutions have been created to help us address our problems and solve our problems.And if the problems and the challenges are very different from those which were prevailing when the organization was created, then the organization needs reform. And we are in the middle of the reform of the United Nations, including the General Assembly. And I wholeheartedly support the further reform, the further so-called revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. And I think the direction that has been taken by the Member States is very encouraging.On the Security Council reform\u2026 I\u2019ve been following these discussions, negotiations, and now, as we call it, intergovernmental negotiations, for more than 20 years. And I\u2019ve heard all the arguments \u2013 pros and cons \u2013 and I\u2019ve also seen the results, or lack of results. While the world is changing, the challenges are changing and becoming more and more complex. It\u2019s evident that communities out there are expecting the United Nations to do better for their safety and security. And I think the Security Council has a great role in that, a very special role.Therefore, I think the intergovernmental negotiations should [continue], should be impact-oriented and should be results-oriented. And of course, I will nominate co-facilitators and I will ask them to be as objective-oriented, as impact-oriented, and as results-oriented as they only can be.But you know much better than I do, it\u2019s a Member State-driven process. It\u2019s not up to the [General Assembly President] to tell them what the result of the negotiations will be and when we can arrive at the result of those negotiations. I will help the co-facilitators. And in case of need, I will help Member States as much as I can in my modest capacity.UN News: Thank you, Mr. President. If I may ask a final question. You promised that your office would promote the values of multiculturalism and multilingualism. In what ways are you going to do so?Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si: Multiculturalism is the shared value, a shared heritage for all of us. We belong to very different nations with very different traditions, very different cultures. Altogether, what we represent is the common heritage of humankind. Any piece of that common heritage that is lost would be a loss for all of us. So, I will pursue it on many, many occasions. Be it with side events, be it exhibitions, [or] special events, I will encourage Member States, bring your heritage, bring your values, share it with other Member States.On multilingualism, we all know there are six official languages of the United Nations. We also know the rules [on how] to use those languages. We also know that it\u2019s a very expensive exercise. But as much as I can, I will push to [ensure that] all six languages are used at the same level. And if possible, let [we should] pay attention to other big languages across the world, because they carry culture, they carry our shared cultural heritage.UN News: Thank you very much. Let me again wish you every success in holding firm the gavel of the President of the General Assembly and in your work that begins now.The 77th session of the UN General Assembly opened on Tuesday with its new president urging world leaders to respond to humanity\u2019s most pressing challenges, including the war in Ukraine, by working together and building bridges across what are \u201cdeep divides\u201d.", "url": "https://news.un.org//en/interview/2022/09/1126781", "title": "INTERVIEW: New General Assembly President will seek every opportunity to build trust"}, {"authors": " Tyler Dragon", "date_publish": "Published 1:00 p.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "Week 2 of the NFL season was the week of the comeback.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nWeek 2 of the NFL season was the week of the comeback.\nThe Miami Dolphins, Arizona Cardinals, New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs overcame deficits of at least 10 points to win.

A Pew Research Poll in June showed 6 in 10 Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, regardless of the stage of pregnancy.\u00a0\nOn the campaign trail:At rally for Dem Senate candidate in Pennsylvania - and beyond - abortion takes center stage\nGraham's proposal for a nationwide ban is a sharp turn from his position\u00a0last\u00a0month\u00a0that states should decide the issue of abortion.\u00a0\nHis bill\u00a0to give federal lawmakers the power to decide the issue is at odds with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who on Tuesday afternoon said most in the GOP conference still believe it should be decided at the state level.\u00a0\nWhen he was asked during his news conference Tuesday about Republicans who still believe it should be left to the states, Graham said, \"That's great. That's their position. That's a sound position. That's not my position.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Graham's bill would strip away women's rights in all 50 states.\n\"This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,\" she said in a statement.\u00a0\nJean-Pierre drew a contrast between President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and congressional Democrats who are working to restore protections in Roe v. Wade, and Republicans in Congress who \"are focused on taking rights away from millions of women.\"\u00a0\nShe reiterated those points during a White House briefing Tuesday afternoon.\n\"It is an extreme piece of legislation, and it is in line, from what we are seeing from Republicans on these extreme agendas that is not in line \u2013 that is not in line \u2013 with the majority of Americans,\" Jean-Pierre said.\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Nora Keefe echoed that message.\u00a0\n\u201cSenate Republicans are showing voters exactly what they would do if they are in charge: pass a nationwide abortion ban and strip away women\u2019s right to make our own health care decisions,\" she said in a statement.\u00a0\nBut\u00a0 Graham's bill is drawing support from anti-abortion leaders, such as March for Life President Jeanne Mancini.\n\u201cLimiting abortions after 15 weeks is the least we can do to protect women, as well as babies who at this stage are already fully formed in their mother\u2019s womb and can feel pain,\" she said in a statement.\nMaureen Ferguson, a senior fellow for The Catholic Association, said in a statement that the limits on abortion in Graham's bill \"are humane and common sense.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We applaud Sen.

It also mirrored\u00a0other independent surveys\u00a0conducted\u00a0in recent weeks\u00a0that point to a competitive race heading into peak campaign season.\nPollsters surveyed 500 likely Ohio voters between Sept. 5 and Sept. 7.\nThe poll comes as Vance and his allies ramp up spending to counter Ryan, who used a massive fundraising haul to dominate the airwaves all summer. The\u00a0Senate Leadership Fund, for instance, announced it would spend $28 million in the Buckeye State and pulled funds from Arizona in part because of an \"unexpected expense in Ohio,\"\u00a0Politico reported. The race in Ohio could help determine which party controls the Senate, which is currently split between Democrats and Republicans.\nVance's campaign placed its first statewide television ad buy of the general election last week,\u00a0according to Medium Buying, a Columbus-based ad-tracking firm.\nMidterms:Will Republicans flip the House?

Vance and other critics are quick to point out that he's voted with President Joe Biden's agenda\u00a0100% of the time,\u00a0although Ryan has largely avoided Biden during the president's trips to Ohio.

But Gov. Chris Sununu, a popular Republican, announced he would not run for the Senate, opening up the nomination to a less-well-known challenger.\n\"Things would look considerably better (for the Republicans) if Sununu was the nominee,\" said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire.\nSenate primary:With Senate control at stake, New Hampshire Republicans are poised to nominate a Trump-like candidate\nSununu and other establishment Republicans are taking aim at Bolduc, the retired\u00a0general who leads polls in a crowded field despite a series of far-right statements that might not play well with moderate voters who tend to decide general elections.\nBolduc insists that Trump won the 2020 election over President Joe Biden, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Valadao still faced two challengers from the right during\u00a0the primary, but did well enough to make it on to the ballot in November \u2013 one of only two GOP impeachers\u00a0(along with Washington State Republican Dan Newhouse)\u00a0to do so.\n10 House Republicans voted to impeach:How are they faring now?\nWhile he is one of the only two GOP impeachment backers to reach the November election, Valadao is\u00a0among\u00a0the most vulnerable incumbents this cycle. He faces a tough reelection battle in this agriculturally key Central Valley district, which became more Democratic\u00a0following\u00a0redistricting.\nDemocrats are excited about their candidate in\u00a0the race, state\u00a0assemblyman Rudy Salas. Salas\u00a0has the backing of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' campaign arm and the Blue Dog PAC, which backs centrist Democrats. Salas was the first Latino Bakersfield city councilmember.\u00a0\nA brand new congressional seat is up for grabs, one of a handful added around the country in redistricting.\nColorado gained a seat\u00a0following the 2020 Census count, and the new lines are competitive: President Joe Biden won the area in 2020, while Trump won it in 2016. The district is more than 30% Hispanic, and extends north from the Denver suburbs to Greeley.\nRedistricting:Voters get fewer choices as Democrats and Republicans dig partisan trenches\nState Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer emerged from a contentious primary to win the Republican nomination for the brand new seat. Kirkmeyer previously served as\u00a0Weld County Commissioner for 20 years.\nDemocrats hope to make abortion a key issue in the race. State Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a Mexican American pediatrician, is the party's nominee.\nAbortion is a key issue in the race: Caraveo backs abortion access, while Kirkmeyer does not\u00a0but\u00a0removed a promise to\u00a0\"defend the sanctity of life\" from her campaign website going into the general election where she'll have to appeal to moderates as well as conservatives.\nA Democratic incumbent who has taken steps to separate himself from his party faces a rematch\u00a0of\u00a0one of the closest races in the 2018 blue wave.\nTrump carried this largely rural\u00a0district by 6 points in 2020, so the odds are against incumbent Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. But Golden, a former Marine\u00a0and one-time staffer to GOP Maine Sen. Susan Collins,\u00a0has taken steps to distance himself from the national party\u00a0by\u00a0voting against Biden's\u00a0Build Back Better and the American Rescue Plan.\nMaine voters are faced with a ranked choice rematch, with Golden facing his 2018 opponent\u00a0former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin. Their\u00a0last\u00a0face-off was the state's\u00a0first Congressional race decided by ranked choice voting\u00a0where Golden eked out a\u00a050.5%-49.5% win.\u00a0\nPoliquin previously represented the Northern Maine district. He was first elected to the seat in 2014, before losing to Golden four years later.\nPoliquin won the first round of ranked choice in 2018, but after two independent candidates were eliminated, Golden was able to overcome him in the next round. Many Republicans have voiced their opposition to ranked choice voting in recent weeks following former GOP Gov. Sarah Palin's loss to Democrat Mary Peltola in Alaska.\u00a0\nMichigan-07: Rep. Elissa Slotkin* (D) vs. Barrett (R)\nIn swingy central Michigan, a moderate Democrat who made a name for herself flipping the district in 2018 faces her most difficult challenge yet.\nRep. Elissa Slotkin is running in Michigan's newly drawn\u00a07th district. The district is anchored around Lansing. Biden carried the seat by less than one point in 2020, and Trump carried\u00a0it in 2016.\nSlotkin was first elected in 2018, when she flipped a traditionally GOP seat. She previously served in the Department of Defense and the\u00a0Central Intelligence Agency.\nShe faces a top Republican recruit: state Sen. Tom Barrett. Barrett is an Army veteran\u00a0who\u00a0previously served in the state House.\u00a0\nBarrett is another Republican nominee\u00a0who has removed anti-abortion language from his campaign materials this summer following his\u00a0primary win. He'd previously described himself as \"100% pro life\" without exception, that language no longer exists on his campaign website.\nVoters are yet to select the Republican nominee to face incumbent Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in this district\u00a0Trump won\u00a0in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Republicans will vote in the GOP primary\u00a0next week, and candidates include two Trump administration alumni.\nPappas, who is openly gay, was elected in 2018. He previously served as a member of the New Hampshire Executive Council. In 2020, he defeated Matt Mowers 51.3%-46.2%\nMowers served in the State Department under Trump, and is the frontrunner in the crowded primary this cycle. Other candidates include former Trump White House assistant press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who would be 25 at the time of election -\u00a0the minimum age requirement to\u00a0serve in\u00a0Congress - and Gail Huff Brown, a former journalist and the wife of former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass.\nIn New Jersey, a Democrat faces\u00a0his\u00a0hardest reelection campaign to date in a GOP district and is aiming to tie a well known political name to Trump.\u00a0\nIncumbent Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski is up for reelection in this New Jersey district\u00a0the Cook Political Report rates as a seat that leans Republican. Biden won the district in 2020, after Trump won it in 2016.\u00a0\nMalinowski was elected in 2018, and previously served as the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor under the Obama administration.\u00a0\nHe faces Republican\u00a0state Sen. Tom Kean, Jr., a moderate son of a popular GOP governor who beat out several challengers to his right to win the nomination. The two faced off previously in 2020, with Malinowski defeating Kean, 50.6%-49.4%. In a non-presidential year with\u00a0Republicans expected to retake the House, that close win could flip in Kean's favor in this rematch.\u00a0\nMalinowski has attempted to tie Kean to Trump, with his last ad saying \"Trump and the MAGA crowd know they can count on Tom Kean Jr.\" and mentioning a possible national abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe decennial redistricting process added Western Albuquerque to this rural district that is currently represented by GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell, making the seat more Democratic.\nHerrell previously served in the state House and is serving in her first term onCapitol\u00a0Hill. A citizen of the Cherokee Nation, she is the first GOP Native woman to serve in Congress.\nHerrell faces Democrat Gabe Vasquez, who previously worked for New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich and served as a\u00a0Las Cruces City Councilor. Vasquez is a first generation American who has stressed his personal story growing up in both the U.S. and Mexico, a bio that fits well with this border district.\nThe longest serving member of the Nevada\u00a0congressional delegation's seat looks a lot less secure this cycle.\nDemocratic Rep. Dina Titus's once-safe seat was redrawn during redistricting to be more competitive. The district now\u00a0contains part of Las Vegas, as well as Boulder City and Henderson. It is more than 30% Hispanic or Latino.\nTitus was elected in 2012 and is the dean of Nevada's Congressional delegation. She previously served as Democratic Majority Leader in the state Senate and worked as a college\u00a0professor.\u00a0\nShe faces GOP challenger\u00a0Mark Robertson, a financial planner who previously served in the military, including as a senior advisor in the\u00a0Office of the Secretary of Defense.\nIn a year where Democrats are playing\u00a0defense in so many areas, they have an opportunity to flip a seat held by\u00a0Republicans for decades in Ohio.\nLongtime GOP Rep. Steve Chabot has represented this southwest Ohio\u00a0district for more than a quarter of a century since his election\u00a0in 1994, even acting as a House\u00a0impeachment manager during the impeachment trial\u00a0of\u00a0former President Bill Clinton.\u00a0\nBut the previously safe Republican seat was redrawn.\u00a0His new district covers an area\u00a0Biden won during redistricting by almost nine points.That gives Democrats a rare pickup opportunity to flip the seat.\u00a0\nThe Democratic candidate in the race is\u00a0Cincinnati City Councilman Greg Landsman, a former public school teacher. Chabot has easily fended off Democratic challengers in recent years\u00a0but with the new lines, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race as a \"toss-up.\"\nRep. Henry Cuellar is one of the last surviving anti-abortion Democrats, and he barely survived a primary challenge.\u00a0Cuellar is a conservative Democrat who has served since\u00a02004, but legal troubles and a strong GOP candidate make this a competitive race.\nCuellar \u2013 weakened by an FBI\u00a0investigation\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0\u2013 faced\u00a0a strong primary challenge from immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros. It\u2019s the second time the two candidates have faced off, and Cuellar\u00a0narrowly\u00a0defeated Cisneros by less than 300 votes.\nHe faces Cassy Garcia in the general election for this Laredo border seat that is more than 70% Hispanic or Latino. Garcia most recently worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and was appointed by Trump to serve as a commissioner for the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative.\u00a0\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., is in the\u00a0political fight for her life against her Republican opponent,\u00a0Prince William County Supervisor Yesli Vega.\nThe National Republican\u00a0Campaign Committee has aggressively targeted Spanberger in hopes of taking back control of the House.\u00a0Spanberger,\u00a0a moderate Democrat, has twice defeated Republicans. In 2018 she\u00a0unseated Tea Party Republican incumbent\u00a0Dave Brat when she was first elected to the House. She then beat state Del. Nick Freitas in 2020\u00a0to win\u00a0reelection.\nDemocrats in the district have rallied voters following the\u00a0Supreme Court's decision\u00a0overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade\u00a0ruling that\u00a0legalized abortion.\u00a0The Democratic Party of Virginia slammed Vega\u2019s anti-abortion views as \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for the district and Spanberger recently\u00a0launched an ad\u00a0against Vega\u2019s abortion views.\u00a0\nContributing: Mabinty Quarshie\nStay updated on the top House races:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/03/house-of-representatives-midterm-election-races-to-watch-updates/7894769001/", "title": "Will Republicans flip the House in midterm elections?

That is, until Monday night as the Bills ran them out of the stadium in a memorable home opener that featured yet another virtuoso performance from the firm of Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs, and a dominant defensive effort that throttled Derrick Henry and forced four turnovers.\nThey would never admit it, but this was surely a game the Bills have been pointing to ever since the schedule came out, not only because it was the home opener, but because they wanted to prove a point against the team that earned the AFC\u2019s No. 1 playoff seed in 2021.\nThe loss two years ago was a similar beatdown that went Tennessee\u2019s way, 42-16, and then last year the Titans survived a last-second fourth-down play, stopping Allen inside the 5-yard-line on that ill-fated QB sneak in a 34-31 loss.\nYou got the feeling, as they were scoring 34 straight points after the Titans had tied the game at 7-7 in the first quarter, the Bills wanted to play all night and just keep pouring it on against their nemesis. Instead, Sean McDermott called off the dogs.\nWith the game so one-sided, both starting quarterbacks - Allen and Tennessee\u2019s Ryan Tannehill - were pulled before the third quarter ended. Case Keenum came in for the Bills and rookie Malik Willis made his NFL debut for the Titans.\nThat doesn\u2019t happen too often in the NFL, and neither does this. If you can believe it, this was Buffalo\u2019s 20th straight regular-season victory by double digits, tying an NFL record that was set by the Chicago Bears of George Halas spanning the 1941 and 1942 seasons.\nHere are some observations:\nIf there\u2019s anyone who loves the bright lights of prime-time games, it\u2019s the Bills star wide receiver. He made a mockery of a pretty good Tennessee secondary by catching 12 passes for 148 yards and three touchdowns before he went to the bench when Allen did.\nThe Titans could not cover him no matter who they lined up opposite him, and what was really impressive is that Tennessee\u2019s two excellent safeties, Amani Hooker and Kevin Byard, couldn\u2019t do anything to help the overmatched corners, a crew that included rookie Roger McCreary, Caleb Farley and Tre Avery.\nThe Bills did better than contain Henry; they pretty much derailed him off the tracks as he finished with just 25 yards on 13 carries.\nSince he entered the NFL with the Vikings in 2016, no player has more receptions (82), receiving yards (949), or touchdowns (12) in Monday night games than Diggs.\nNFL WEEK 2 WINNERS, LOSERS:Patriots offense shows improvement, Cowboys still have hope\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\nThe No. 1 priority when you play the Titans is to at least try to contain the locomotive that is Henry. When the Titans get Henry going, everything on their offense works better, especially Tannehill\u2019s play-action game.\nHenry had just 12 yards on eight carries in the first half, though he did score a touchdown. And by the time the Bills went ahead 27-7 on Allen\u2019s 46-yard TD pass to Diggs five minutes into the third quarter, and then a Tyler Bass field goal, Henry had only 14 yards on 11 carries.\nIt\u2019s rare when any team can slow Henry down like that, but the Bills were outstanding at the point of attack. And they were able to do this even though two of their top defensive tackles, Ed Oliver and Tim Settle, were inactive due to injuries.\nDT\u2019s Jordan Phillips and DaQuan Jones each played a big role in filling the void left by Oliver and Settle, and as they were holding up the Titans blockers and preventing them from opening holes or getting to the second level, it allowed other defenders to make plays.\nHenry was tackled for lost yardage on five plays by five different players - CB Christian Benford, DE Greg Rousseau, LB Tremaine Edmunds, DE Von Miller and S Jordan Poyer. That\u2019s some impressive work.\nAs enjoyable as the victory was, the Bills came out of it tremendously banged up which is not great when they\u2019re facing a trip down the AFC East rival Miami Sunday in a game that will be for first pace.\nWith a little less than a minute to play in the first half, cornerback Dane Jackson was making a tackle on Titans wide receiver Treylon Burks when Edmunds came flying in and accidentally hit Jackson in the head, snapping his neck back.\nA hush fell over the crowd, and though Jackson was seen moving on the field, the Bills\u2019 trainers took every precaution. They unscrewed his facemask and immobilized his head before placing him on a backboard. He was then loaded into an ambulance and taken to Erie Community Medical Center in Buffalo.\nThe Bills announced in the press box that Jackson had full movement of his extremities and he was going to undergo a CT scan and an X-ray at the hospital.\nWith Jackson out, the Bills had to rely on their two rookie cornerbacks, Christian Benford and Kaiir Elam, for the rest of the night. Benford started for the second game in a row, and Elam mixed in after the second series and the rotation would have continued if Jackson had not gotten hurt.\nThen in the second half, the Bills suffered three more injuries to their starting defense. Safety Micah Hyde went down with a neck injury and after he slowly walked off the field, he went into the blue medical tent and then was carted to the locker room. Jaquan Johnson took Hyde\u2019s place.\nLater, linebacker Matt Milano - shortly after his 43-yard interception return for a touchdown - left the game with a stinger. And then Phillips had to exit with a hamstring injury.\nDuring the first half when it was still a game, the Tennessee defense gave the Bills all kinds of problems in short yardage situations.\nThe Bills had 10 plays where all they needed was one or two yards to get a first down, and they failed on seven of them. The only ones they converted came via an offside penalty on Tennessee, a pass to Dawson Knox that converted a third-and-2 at the Titans 23 and set up Allen\u2019s TD pass to Reggie Gilliam on the next snap. And then on fourth-and-1 from the 4-yard line late in the half, Allen found Diggs alone in the end zone to give the Bills a 17-7 lead.\nOne of the failures came on fourth-and-1 at the Titans 31 and Allen tried to throw a short pass was engulfed by Zack Cunningham and was lucky the ball wasn\u2019t intercepted.\nThe biggest problem is that the offensive line - which played part of the half without center Mitch Morse who injured his elbow - couldn\u2019t get any movement against Tennessee\u2019s front led by Jeffery Simmons.\nHowever, the Bills had no such problems in the second half as they steamrolled the Titans into the ground.\nFollow Sal Maiorana\u00a0on Twitter @salmaiorana.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/sports/nfl/2022/09/19/buffalo-bills-demolish-tennessee-titans-monday-night-football/10431858002/", "title": "Buffalo Bills nearly flawless in Monday night rout of the Tennessee Titans in home opener"}, {"authors": " Nate Davis", "date_publish": "Published: 9:19 p.m. ET Sept. 18, 2022 Updated: 1:25 p.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022", "description": "The 32\u00a0things we learned from Week 2\u00a0of the 2022\u00a0NFL season:", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nThe 32\u00a0things we learned from Week 2\u00a0of the 2022\u00a0NFL season:\n1. Don't think\u00a0Tua Tagovailoa wants to strike deep down the field? All he did was throw four fourth-quarter touchdown passes \u2013 including a 48- and 60-yarder to WR Tyreek Hill \u2013 Sunday afternoon in Baltimore, leading the Miami Dolphins back from a 35-14 deficit to an improbable 42-38 triumph.\n2.\u00a0Tagovailoa (469 yards) joined Hall of Famers Bob Griese and Dan Marino as the only Dolphins to throw six TDs in a game.\u00a0\n3. More importantly, Tua and his team are off to a 2-0 start, something his more celebrated 2020 first-round draftmates, Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert, can't claim.\n4. It's usually not a good idea to try \"taking receipts\" from the New York media, but that's the route Jets coach Robert Saleh took last week in the wake of his team's uninspired Week 1 loss to Baltimore. Looks like the NYJ coach will collect his share of rebates this week after his team shocked the Browns 31-30 in Cleveland, scoring a pair of TDs in the final 82 seconds to complete the comeback.\n5. Saleh also started seeing the returns from his vaunted rookie class, first-round WR Garrett Wilson (8 catches, 102 yards, 2 TDs) and second-round RB\u00a0Breece Hall (60 total yards, TD) both with big afternoons.\n6. Interim Jets QB1 Joe Flacco (307 yards passing, 4 TDs) improved to 18-3 all-time against the Browns.\n7. The Browns fell to 0-1 with that ridiculous new Keebler-looking elf logo at midfield ... but hopefully \"Brownie\" passed out some delicious postgame Fudge Stripes.\n8. Also, no chance QB\u00a0Jimmy Garoppolo is coming to that Cleveland locker room in 2022 now that San Francisco 49ers starter Trey Lance is lost for the season.\n9. Lance will officially be credited with the win from\u00a0Sunday's 27-7 thrashing of the Seattle Seahawks. But what a personal catastrophe for the No. 3 pick of the 2021 draft, who was carted off the field in the first quarter with an air cast on his fractured right ankle\u00a0\u2013 one that will require season-ending surgery.\n10. As for the \"Faithful,\" at least it's no small consolation knowing Jimmy G\u00a0has gotten this team at least as far as the NFC title game in two of the past three seasons. And given how relatively thin this year's NFC field appears, no reason to believe the 49ers aren't still Super Bowl-caliber.\n11. However, it's now the Niners who will suddenly enter the quarterback market. Going into Sunday, Garoppolo gave them the best backup situation in the league. Now that's been turned on its head, the only other passer on the roster being rookie\u00a0Brock Purdy, the \"Mr. Irrelevant\" as the 262nd and final pick of the 2022 NFL draft.\n12. Aaron Rodgers' ownership of the Chicago Bears continues, the Packers star improving to 24-5 all time against Green Bay's archrival\u00a0with Sunday night's 27-10 win. Rodgers also threw his 450th career TD pass, the fifth player in NFL annals to reach the benchmark.\n12a. Pack coach Matt LaFleur should get co-ownership status. He's now\u00a07-0 against the Bears.\n12b. The Packers are\u00a0104-95-6 overall against Chicago, gaining further breathing room in the league's longest-running rivalry.\n13. Continuing with the comeback theme, Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals couldn't hit sand from a dune buggy in Las Vegas, trailing the Raiders 20-0 deep into the third quarter. But the Cards came all the way back for a 29-23 triumph thanks to Murray's improvisational heroics and CB\u00a0Byron Murphy Jr.'s 59-yard TD off a\u00a0Hunter Renfrow fumble in overtime.\n13a. But the play of the game was Murray's successful\u00a0scramble\u00a0on a two-point conversion to cut the lead to 23-15. Murray actually ran nearly 85 circuitous yards over nearly 21 seconds ... on an untimed down.\nNEVER MISS A SNAP:Sign up for our NFL newsletter for exclusive content\n14. The wins by Arizona and Miami marked the first time in NFL history that two teams overcame halftime deficits of at least 20 points on the same day.\n14a. There have already been\u00a012 games decided by three points or fewer this season, the most after two weeks of play in league history.\n15. In the\u00a0first game following the Russell Wilson era, the Seattle offense mustered two TDs. Sunday, it posted none (and all of 216 yards).\n15a. Meanwhile, Wilson was booed lustily for the second straight game\u00a0\u2013 though Sunday's serenade was much more shocking from a Broncos fan base that had been excited by his arrival this offseason. Wilson was\u00a014-of-31 for 219 yards with one TD and one INT while throwing to a receiving corps depleted of most of its notable players aside from WR Courtland Sutton. But Denver pulled out a 16-9 win over the Houston Texans despite Wilson's struggles, 13 more Broncos penalties, hapless red-zone play ... and the crowd counting down the play clock because that was apparently too much for rookie coach Nathaniel Hackett's offense to keep track of.\n16. Was there ever any doubt Dallas Cowboys QB2 Cooper Rush would up his career record to 2-0 by beating the Cincinnati Bengals in his first start in place of temporarily injured starter Dak Prescott? Was there? Paging my good friend, pessimist\u00a0Jarrett Bell ;)\n16a. The Cowboys were the only team in the league that didn't score a TD in Week 1, but they hit pay dirt twice against Cincinnati.\n17. However, the story of this Dallas team Sunday\u00a0\u2013 as may be the case all season\u00a0\u2013 was a defense that limited the defending AFC champs to 17 points (one TD) and 254 yards while sacking QB Joe Burrow six times.\n18. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers broke their seven-game regular-season losing streak to the New Orleans Saints, not that QB Tom Brady will take much solace. Though the Bucs are 2-0, the Brady-led offense has only managed two total TDs this season, and the GOAT spent nearly as much time yelling at his teammates as he did at the Saints.\n19. Speaking of which \u2013 even though chatty former Saints DB\u00a0C.J. Gardner-Johnson is now in Philadelphia \u2013 TB12 and Co. still got an earful from the Saints, the teams even exchanging blows as Pro Bowlers Mike Evans (Tampa Bay) and\u00a0Marshon Lattimore (New Orleans) were ejected and potentially facing additional discipline.\u00a0\n20. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson was ultimately outdueled by\u00a0Tagovailoa\u00a0\u2013 he can largely thank his defense for that\u00a0\u2013 but did make more history Sunday. Jackson became the first player in league history to run and pass for TDs of at least 75 yards in the same game. His 119 yards rushing also marked the 11th time in his career he reached the century mark, a record among quarterbacks.\n21. Jared Goff and Carson Wentz were the top two picks, respectively, of the 2016 NFL draft, though neither remains with his original team. Goff (256 yards passing, 4 TDs) got the best of Wentz and the Commanders, improving to 2-1 against the man he also bested in the draft six years ago.\n22. Goff had plenty of help from a young man who's emerging as one of the league's top receivers.\u00a0Amon-Ra St. Brown led Detroit with 68 yards rushing, which was the cherry on top of a nine-catch, 116-yard, two-TD day. It was St. Brown's sixth consecutive game with at least eight grabs and a TD, a feat never before accomplished during the Super Bowl era (since 1966).\n23. Lions DE\u00a0Aidan Hutchinson made early hay in the defensive rookie of the year race, dumping Wentz for three first-half sacks.\n24. Did you really think the Patriots were going to lose to the Steelers? Since Bill Belichick came to New England, the Pats are 13-4 against Pittsburgh.\n24a. Did you really think the Patriots were going to lose to the Steelers? Since Bill Belichick came to New England, the Pats haven't started 0-2 since 2001 ... which was before Brady became their starting QB.\u00a0\u00a0\n25. Hard to explain the Jacksonville Jaguars' recent dominance of the AFC South rival Indianapolis Colts ... and yet\u00a0Sunday marked the third time the Jags have shut out the Colts in the past six seasons.\u00a0\n26. Indy has lost its last eight trips to Jacksonville.\n27. If you were starting Rams WR\u00a0Brandon Powell on your fantasy team, you were already in trouble. But if you did, you ate minus-26 rushing yards after he intentionally took a safety as Los Angeles desperately outlasted the Falcons, 31-27, a game the champs led 28-3 (yep) in the second half.\n28. If you were starting highly touted Atlanta TE Kyle Pitts on your fantasy team ... welp, he had two catches for 19 yards\u00a0\u2013 exactly replicating his Week 1 production.\n29. A body slam (Chargers S Derwin James on Chiefs TE Travis Kelce), gutty performance (Herbert), script-flipping 99-yard pick-six\u00a0(Chiefs CB Jaylen Watson) and Patrick Mahomes' general brilliance? If Thursday night's Chiefs-Chargers throwdown was indicative of how this year's AFC West brawls will play out ... as Bart Scott would say, \"Can't wait.\"\n30. That said, as much a devotee to analytics that Bolts coach Brandon Staley is, very limited upside to exposing Herbert (fractured rib cartilage) to further injury\u00a0\u2013 even if the second-year star's toughness made the final score closer after he threaded two perfect throws, including a 7-yard TD pass, on LA's final drive.\n31.Embattled Carolina Panthers coach Matt Rhule is off to an 0-2 start for the second time in three seasons. On the bright side, the Nebraska and Arizona State jobs are already open.\n32. Ever the first-class organization, the Ravens did a wonderful job honoring the memories of former players Tony Siragusa and\u00a0Jaylon Ferguson. Both men died in June. A helmet decal was worn to commemorate them, and several of Siragusa's teammates from Baltimore's first championship club (2000) emerged from the team's tunnel in his No. 98 jersey.\n***\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2022/09/18/nfl-week-2-32-things-we-learned/10420120002/", "title": "32 things we learned from Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season: Tua Tagovailoa leads Dolphins comeback"}, {"authors": "Parker Gabriel", "date_publish": "Published: 6:46 p.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022 Updated: 6:52 p.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022", "description": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 Denver Broncos tight end/fullback\u00a0Andrew Beck got pushed out of bounds short of a first down on a befuddling third-down run call with four minutes, 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter Sunday against Houston.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 Denver Broncos tight end/fullback\u00a0Andrew Beck got pushed out of bounds short of a first down on a befuddling third-down run call with four minutes, 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter Sunday against Houston.\nThe Broncos at the time trailed the Texans, 9-6, but were running the ball efficiently, so the first head-scratcher was giving Beck, with one carry to his name in the past three seasons, what looked like an option read with Javonte Williams as the pitch man.\nWhat happened next, though, was even more difficult to figure.\nNearly 20 seconds of game time rolled off the clock before quarterback Russell Wilson, who appeared to be looking for a fourth-down call from his head coach, and the offense came off the field and the field goal unit trotted on for what would have been a 53-yard attempt to tie the game.\nExcept by the time the decision was made, that group was in\u00a0a time crunch. When holder Corliss Waitman dropped to a knee and kicker Brandon McManus toed his spot,\u00a0only five seconds remained on the play clock. Those melted away and Denver was flagged for a delay of game. Instead of a 59-yard attempt, head coach Nathaniel Hackett sent on the punt team.\nBoos rang through a beautiful afternoon at Empower Field at Mile High following the latest in a string of double-clutch decisions from Hackett.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things and we need to make sure the communication is clear and concise,\" he said Monday.\u00a0\"I need to do better at making decisions faster and quicker and getting that information to the quarterback and being on the same page as him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we were talking about this morning all the way to this evening and making sure. It\u2019s got to improve.\u201d\n32 THINGS WE LEARNED:Comebacks galore during NFL Week 2\nNFL WEEK 2 WINNERS, LOSERS:Patriots offense shows improvement, Cowboys still have hope\nNEVER MISS A SNAP:Sign up for our NFL newsletter for exclusive content\nEarlier in the game, faced with a fourth-and-goal from Houston\u2019s 2-yard line, Hackett again took time following an incompletion to\u00a0opt against keeping his offense on the field and the same thing happened \u2014 a delay of game on the late-arriving field goal unit.\n\u201cI was considering on both of those situations (whether to go for it or kick the field goal) and that\u2019s where I just need to be better in communicating with everybody, getting the proper information and making the right decision,\u201d Hackett said.\nThe first time didn\u2019t cost Denver points, but both instances added to a lengthening\u00a0list of times through two weeks when decisions appear to not come quickly enough from Hackett. With a minute left and trailing 17-16 in Week 1 at Seattle, Hackett, armed with all three timeouts, opted to run 40 seconds off the play clock and attempt a 64-yard field goal rather than keep his offense on the field for a fourth-and-5 attempt. A day later, he said in retrospect that Denver, \u201cdefinitely should have gone for it.\u201d\nPart of the now-recurring problem, Hackett said in this week\u2019s postmortem, is streamlining who communicates with him on the headset going forward.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s that and I think I need to just be ahead of it a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re calling plays, you naturally want to get the next play going. I think getting that information a little bit earlier, those are the things that we\u2019re talking through and going through and making sure that I have all the right information. The most important thing is being on the same page with Russell, also. Letting him know, \u2018hey, we may have four downs here.\u2019 I think I can do a better job in making him aware of that.\u201d\nThe rookie head coach said he\u2019s aggressive by nature and sometimes needs to ensure he\u2019s making the right decision for his team. In any of those\u00a0three instances in which he\u2019s eventually called for his field goal unit, it is difficult to imagine that any of his staff or his players would have blamed him for keeping Wilson\u00a0\u2014 who Denver traded five picks and three players for in March and just signed to a $245 million extension\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the offense on the field.\nCertainly, if he was still an offensive coordinator, he\u2019d have at least considered lobbying for the ball to be in his quarterback's hands, particularly one of Wilson\u2019s caliber.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, looking back at all my time in the past and conversations that go on, you always have an opinion,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when it\u2019s now your decision is the one that matters. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m as efficient as I can possibly be and communicate the best way that I can.\n\u201cUp to this point, I haven\u2019t done that. I know I can be a lot better.\u201d\nHackett expressed confidence in himself and his staff and said that while he\u2019s always open to change, he\u2019s not imminently planning on adding a more veteran offensive voice \u2014 Denver\u2019s a young staff across the board, though the defense does have a pair of experienced senior assistants in Dom Capers and Bill Kolar \u2014 or adjusting his own gameday duties. He added that he believes\u00a0the communication and decision-making issues can be rectified quickly.\n\u201cIn those moments, it happens so fast. The process of what we do \u2014 every single thing that we do is a process \u2014 getting to gameday, during gameday, everything is a process,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cProcess, process, process.\n\u201cWe just need to tighten that process up so we can make decisions faster.\u201d\u00a0", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/sports/nfl/broncos/2022/09/19/nathaniel-hackett-fix-denver-broncos-game-management-issues/10430233002/", "title": "Denver Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett vows to solve slow decision-making, communication issues"}, {"authors": " Lorenzo Reyes", "date_publish": "Published: 6:09 a.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022 Updated: 7:34 a.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022", "description": "A wild finish to the early slate of the Week 2 slate of NFL games Sunday provided plenty of drama, and some historic comebacks.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nA wild finish to the early slate of the Week 2 slate of NFL games Sunday provided plenty of drama, and some historic comebacks.\nAnd it was two AFC East teams in particular who were on the road and stunned their opponents.

This franchise has done you wrong way too many times in the past 30 years.\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now for exclusive content sent to your inbox\nNFL WEEK 2 WINNERS, LOSERS:Patriots offense shows improvement, Cowboys still have hope\nBut this team deserves a little bit of grace. We all saw in January what the Bengals can do. All the key players are still here. Joe Burrow is too good to keep struggling the way he has in the first two games. Despite the offensive woes, the Bengals have still given themselves a chance to win each of the first two games.\nRemember, the Bengals were sluggish out of the gate last season. The first two games of 2021 were both decided by three points \u2013 just like this season. The difference is the Bengals were able to salvage one of the first two games last year, defeating Minnesota in overtime in the opener.\nThe Bengals then went to Chicago in Week 2 and laid a big, fat egg against a terrible Bears team. Burrow threw three interceptions against the Bears. The offense then put it together. The Bengals won two straight games, and four of their next five. They were off and running in that magical season\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys have better defenses than the first two opponents of 2021. Comparing the first few weeks of 2021 and 2022 is relevant because slow offensive starts have been a trend during Zac Taylor\u2019s coaching tenure with the Bengals. The Bengals are not doing a good enough job preparing for the season in training camp and preseason games.\nThey should be ready now. There will be no excuses for losing to QB Joe Flacco and the Jets (1-1), who are coming off a thrilling 31-30 victory in Cleveland.\nThe Browns, Pittsburgh and Baltimore all lost on Sunday. The AFC North getting swept is another reason why it\u2019s not time to panic about the Bengals. All their division rivals have a loss.\nBut you\u2019re still worried about that supposedly rebuilt offensive line. And rightfully so.\nThe Bengals\u2019 offensive front has been a sieve so far this season. Cincinnati gave up six more sacks against the Cowboys. That\u2019s 13 through two games, putting the Bengals on pace to give up more than 110 in the regular season. They gave up 70 between the regular season and playoffs last year \u2212 and that was way too many\nLast week, Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan told reporters that not all the sacks were on the offensive line. It was an effort to take the heat off the starting offensive line, which didn\u2019t get to take any snaps together in the preseason. He said the line was responsible for three or four\u00a0of the Pittsburgh sacks. That\u2019s still way too many.\nBengals coaches continued to defend the line after Sunday's performance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not frustrating,\u201d Taylor said when asked about the sacks. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity to win these games against good teams. Once things settle down, I know that we\u2019re going to be a really good football team. We all believe that.\u201d\nThings better settle down quickly. The line gets one more game to show marked improvement before it\u2019s time to start seriously questioning whether the front office completely botched the rebuild. You can\u2019t say you\u2019re building everything around Burrow and put a porous and shoddy line in front of him.\nThe pressure is on everyone in the Bengals organization heading into New York\nContact sports columnist Jason Williams by email at jwilliams@enquirer.com and on\u00a0Twitter @jwilliamscincy.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/sports/nfl/bengals/2022/09/19/cincinnati-bengals-not-time-to-panic/10426107002/", "title": "It's not yet time to panic about Bengals, but Sunday's game against Jets is a must-win | Opinion"}, {"authors": " Jori Epstein", "date_publish": "Published: 1:00 a.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022 Updated: 10:05 a.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022", "description": "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Cooper Rush\u2019s demeanor, as usual, hadn\u2019t changed.\u00a0", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Cooper Rush\u2019s demeanor, as usual, hadn\u2019t changed.\u00a0\nSo an incredulous reporter asked: \u201cAre you excited? You happy?\u201d\u00a0\nThe Cowboys quarterback cracked a smile.\u00a0\n\u201cWinning an NFL game,\u201d he conceded, \u201cis fun.\u201d\u00a0\nThus concluded the postgame emotion for the quarterback who completed 19-of-31 passes for 235 yards and one touchdown, while improving to 2-0 in his career starts.\u00a0\nThe Cowboys had entered their home contest vs. the Cincinnati Bengals as 7.5-point underdogs after losing franchise quarterback Dak Prescott to a thumb fracture that required surgery on his throwing hand. Could they rebound from an already league-worst offensive production in their season-opening loss? Could a pressure-enforcing defense wreak enough havoc with talented quarterback Joe Burrow to complement an evolving offense?\u00a0\nThe Cowboys held off Cincinnati, 20-17, Rush engineering a game-winning drive in the final minute that kicker Brett Maher\u2019s 50-yard field goal sealed. Six sacks of Joe Burrow drove the performance.\u00a0\n\u201cWe just bought into each other and said, \u2018F what everybody else thinks, this is about us,\u2019\u201d said linebacker Micah Parsons, who notched two sacks, five quarterback hits and four total tackles. \u201cAnd I think we came out here and proved that.\u201d\u00a0\nTo the Cowboys\u2019 credit, they didn\u2019t only try to force plays from their veteran superstars. Sure, Ezekiel Elliott wore down the Bengals with 15 carries for 53 yards and third-year receiver CeeDee Lamb improved from 2-of-11 last week to 7-of-11 this week for 76 yards.\u00a0\nBut arguably the most meaningful offensive performances came from Rush, wide receiver Noah Brown and running back Tony Pollard. The trio who long represented Dallas\u2019 second-team offense \u2014 if not third \u2014 were now ready to flash their chemistry as starters.\u00a0\nTake the Cowboys\u2019 first offensive series, when Rush and Lamb seemed to be on different pages en route to a third-down incompletion. The Cowboys now faced fourth-and-2 at their own 44. They stayed on the field, to what the Bengals later admitted was a surprise.\u00a0\nRush stayed calm as Bengals nose tackle D.J. Reader closed, finding Brown 17 yards upfield to extend the drive.\u00a0\n\u201cAny time you can show confidence in your team, that\u2019s what you want to do as a coach,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI just had confidence in the situation, confidence in the call and obviously it was excellent execution.\u201d\u00a0\nSix plays later, Rush found Brown on a diving 9-yard touchdown.\u00a0\nAdd in a 46-yard Pollard burst up the left sideline the next series, and a 1-yard end zone punch, and the Cowboys had scored touchdowns on their first two offensive drives for the first time since October 2019. Rush said starting fast was an emphasis in practice this week.\u00a0\nEnd-of-game and two-minute scenarios were, too.\u00a0\nThe Cowboys would need that.\u00a0\nDespite carrying a 17-3 lead into halftime, Dallas went scoreless for 29-plus minutes of the second half. Dallas\u2019 defense largely held up on a six-sack day that left Bengals star kicker Evan McPherson attempting and connecting on field goals from 43, 46 and 50. Still, a shaky offensive second half for the Cowboys gave the defense little room to breathe. The Bengals more than doubled the Cowboys\u2019 time of possession after the half, Dallas\u2019 longest drive a seven-play, three-minute series that ended unceremoniously in tight end Dalton Schultz fumbling.\u00a0\nThen, with the game tied in the final two minutes, Dallas\u2019 defense held off on first down. They held on second. Burrow found receiver Tyler Boyd in the flat on third-and-3.\u00a0\nCowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs found Boyd 2 yards short of the chains.\u00a0\n\u201cThe hardest we\u2019ve seen Diggs tackle,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cHe shot out like a cannon. \u2026 Huge momentum.\u201d\u00a0\nRush found Lamb down the left sideline for 8 yards. Then Brown, his most efficient target on the day, caught a 12-yard tipped ball up the middle. Lamb followed up with another 10-yard gain beneath two tacklers.\u00a0\nMaher stepped up comfortably to finish the job.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the utmost confidence in his ability to lead us in the two-minute drive in the back end of the game,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cFor him to come through again and come out victorious? That\u2019s Cooper Rush for you.\u201d\u00a0\nJerry Jones insisted Rush\u2019s heroics won\u2019t alter the timeline for Prescott\u2019s return, Jones adding that benchmark hinges less on concern of reinjury than it does on confidence in throwing strength and ability to grip the ball. Surgery and a clean break indicated a realistic four-to-six-week timeline, per multiple reports. But the Cowboys declined to put Prescott on injured reserve, Jones insisting Prescott could return sooner.\u00a0\n\u201cThis game has no bearing on that at all,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAll it does is confirm we have good quarterbacks backing him up ... and take a lot of the angst out of it.\u201d\u00a0\nNFL WEEK 2:32 things we learned\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\nThe Cowboys next play at the Giants, against the Commanders, and at the defending Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.

President Joe Biden\u2019s 1-million-barrels-a-day oil release from the country\u2019s emergency reserves is set to end in October, Europe\u2019s energy crisis is expected to hit hardest during the cold winter months, and the largest oil-producing countries could\u00a0cut production, other analysts noted.\u00a0\nBiden's inflation moves:Is Biden responsible for dip in inflation? President's victory lap is premature, experts say\nInflation here to stay?:\u00a0High prices leave experts wondering when we'll see relief\nPrices of oil and natural gas have room to rise, which\u00a0consumers would feel at the pump and at home, analysts say.\u00a0\nOil makes up about half the price of a gallon of gasoline, and\u00a0diesel fuel for vehicles like trucks and heating oil for homes are distilled from oil. Most U.S.\u00a0residential sector\u00a0and\u00a0commercial sector\u00a0heating oil consumption occurs in the\u00a0New England and the mid-Atlantic regions.\u00a0\nAbout half of\u00a0U.S. homes use natural gas to heat homes and water. Natural gas also is often used to generate electricity, which is why\u00a0electricity prices have risen 15.8% in the 12 months to August. Because of Europe\u2019s struggle to fill its natural gas inventory before winter, natural gas prices have spiked to a 14-year high.\u00a0\u00a0\nHigh natural gas prices have prompted some switching to burning oil or coal for electricity.\u00a0\nSolar panel options:Here are the basics of how solar panels work\nHow do heat pumps work?:What to know about installation, extreme cold\nThe average cost of home heating is expected to rise 17.2%\u00a0from last winter\u00a0to $1,202, the second consecutive year of major prices increases and the highest price in more than a decade, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) said.\u00a0\nAlready, more than 20 million families, or about 1 of 6 American families, are behind on their utility bills, it said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe rise in home energy costs this winter will put millions of lower-income families at risk of falling behind on their energy bills and having no choice but to make difficult decisions between paying for food, medicine and rent,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director.\u00a0\nFor 2022, NEADA\u00a0sees the cost of utility services rising to $3,803, reflecting high prices for natural gas, heating oil and propane and this summer\u2019s heat waves. The high temperatures\u00a0increased air conditioning costs to about $600 from $450, on average, last summer.\u00a0\nSmart savings:These smart home products can make a big difference on your energy and insurance bills\nInflation still high:Falling gas prices aren't enough to help offset higher cost of housing, food, child care\nYes, oil and gasoline prices fell sharply on less demand as drivers cut back this summer when pump prices surged, prospects grew for recessions around the globe, and China locked\u00a0down regions as it tried to halt the spread of COVID-19.\nThe gasoline index shed 10.6% in August from July, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its consumer price index report on Tuesday. That reflected the steady decline this summer in the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline to $3.71 this week, a level not seen since the beginning of March and mostly on the heels of lower oil prices, AAA said on Monday. Oil prices are down about a third from their June peaks that pushed gas prices just above $5 a\u00a0gallon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut as those fell, natural gas prices continued to climb as Russia cut its supply to Europe,\u00a0creating frantic global demand.\u00a0\nPump relief:Gas prices have dropped for over 30 days. Where is gas the cheapest \u2013 and most expensive?\nEnd to cruel summer:Crude oil prices are down. Here's what it could mean for gas prices at the pump.\nFirst, Biden\u2019s daily releases from the strategic petroleum reserves end next month\u00a0if the administration doesn\u2019t extend it,\u00a0which would eliminate\u00a0one\u00a0supply source. Further, the reserves have fallen to their lowest since October 1984, U.S. Department of Energy data show, and those reserves eventually\u00a0will have to be replaced, taking out future supply.\u00a0\nMore important, on Dec. 5, the Group of Seven industrialized nations of Japan, the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Germany, France and Italy plan to cap Russian oil prices.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIf they do, Russia says it\u2019s cutting everything \u2013 oil and natural gas exports \u2013 off,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP.\u00a0 If that happens, \u201coil prices will retest the highs set in June and cause the average price of regular gas to move well back above the current $3.70 per gallon.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd natural gas prices probably would surge again.\u00a0\nCapacity issues:Gas prices surge again to record high but the driver is refineries, not oil prices\nPersistent inflation:Are we stuck with blistering inflation? Stubbornly high prices leave experts wondering when we'll see relief\nBy not\u00a0buying Russian oil above a certain price still be determined, G7 countries would limit Russia\u2019s oil revenue to finance its war in Ukraine.\u00a0\nEnforcing the cap would rely heavily on denying London-brokered shipping insurance, which covers about 95% of the world's tanker fleet, and finance to cargo priced above the cap.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe cap avoids an outright ban of Russian oil that\u00a0could have\u00a0sent world oil prices surging since Russia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil to global markets and the second largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia. Caps ensure Russian oil can continue to flow but still deplete Russia\u2019s coffers.\u00a0\nIn response, Moscow warned it would stop selling oil and natural gas to countries imposing\u00a0price caps on Russian energy exports. That, analysts say, would cut supply and send prices of both fuels higher.\u00a0\nClimate control:Remote, stealth commands tamper with temperatures in Portland area homes \u2014 all to save energy\nReshaping minds:'Shaking up our way of thinking': Europe saving energy in anticipation of Russian gas shutoff; Senate backs NATO expansion: Ukraine updates\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 10 other major non-OPEC oil-exporting nations (collectively called OPEC+) could agree to raise oil production, but it has been loath to do so.\u00a0\nAfter oil prices plummeted when economies closed to slow the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020, OPEC+ has been cautious in raising production for fear of getting burned again. Earlier this month, the group surprised markets and trimmed production targets by about 100,000 barrels a day from October. It was seen as a symbolic move to telegraph that it\u2019s monitoring oil prices and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to act if it felt oil prices were falling too fast or too much.\u00a0\nSome also question whether OPEC+ can even produce much more oil. The group has regularly failed to meet its own production quota because of capacity constraints in some countries.\u00a0\nPump more, please:Biden is pressing the Saudis to increase oil production. Experts say the kingdom isn't likely to agree\nWhipsawed:Understanding the Gas Price Rollercoaster\nEuropeans, because they rely on Russian natural gas. Russia\u00a0already has\u00a0closed two major pipelines\u00a0to Europe. That has sent prices up 300% from last year to the highest levels since 2008.\u00a0\nBut Americans also are feeling pain. The U.S. has sent record liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to help\u00a0it boost supplies before winter. But now, as prices climb, the U.S. finds\u00a0its stockpiles low. \u00a0\n\u201cWe appreciate that the Biden Administration has been working with European allies to expand fuel exports to Europe,\u201d six New England governors wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in July.\u00a0\u201cA similar effort should be made for New England,\u201d the only U.S. region that imports liquefied natural gas because it doesn\u2019t have ready access to U.S. supplies.\nEast Coast distillates, including diesel, and gasoline inventories also\u00a0linger near record seasonal lows.\u00a0\nShocking oil:Americans rationed gas during WWII and the 1970s oil shocks. Will that happen in \u2018Putin\u2019s war\u2019?\nTaxing oil:Millions live near Superfund sites. An oil industry tax in the climate bill could pay to clean those up\nGranholm has asked major\u00a0producers to export less fuel to Europe and other countries, but that\u2019s not likely to\u00a0help because energy markets are global, analysts say. Slowing exports to regions that need oil or gas will increase the prices there and everywhere, analysts say.\u00a0\nInstead, analysts say the administration needs to tackle supply. \u00a0\n\u201cIf we had the Marcellus pipeline to Pennsylvania, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d said David Rewcastle, University of New Haven analyst and economics professor. A pipeline between the lush natural gas Marcellus shale and New England was blocked by former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\u00a0\nCorporate greed:Critics say corporate greed is making inflation worse, citing record profits despite rising costs\nFracking and pipelines:Trump keeps talking about fracking in Pennsylvania: Here's what we know about this hot campaign issue\nChevron chief executive Mike Wirth also has criticized the government for crushing incentives for companies to produce more oil with\u00a0calls for windfall taxes and ending fossil fuels in coming years.\u00a0\n\u201cWe will be paying for it,\u201d Rewcastle said, noting there\u2019s no short-term solution. \u201cMaybe this will be a teachable moment.\u201d\u00a0\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

If you want the\u00a0cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of TVs to watch your favorite content or play the latest video games, look no further than the LG C2 4K Smart TV. Even better, you can get it at Walmart for one of the lowest prices of the year.\u00a0\nYou can get the screen in its 48-inch model at the home shopping outlet for $200 off at $1,196.99. Typically listed for $1,396.99, Walmart has the UHD OLED TV with Dolby Vision for 14% off right now.\u00a0\n\u25baReviewed End-of-Summer Stealsfest: Save hundreds with exclusive deals on Madewell, Solo Stove and iRobot\n\u25baThermoWorks Warehouse sale: Shop tasty deals and save 60% on Reviewed-approved kitchen products now\nWhen we tested the LG C2, almost every aspect of its picture quality wowed us. It's one of the brightest TVs we've ever tried, along with having\u00a0perfect black levels and flawless contrast control. You'll see\u00a0incredibly rich, dazzling-looking color the second you plug it in and all four of its HDMI 2.1 ports\u00a0support 4K gaming at 120 frames per second, with Auto Low Latency and Variable Refresh Rate. That means if you managed to score a PlayStation 5\u00a0or Xbox Series X, the C2 will give you the best gaming experience possible.\nAnd all of those features come in a sleek package. Our testers found the TV pannel to be slimmer than most smartphones, with it having a more boxy look than prior LG OLED models. The most notable change on the C2 is with its pedestal stand, jutting out much less than older designs while still being angled downward. This gives the TV the look of being lifted off the ground while also having more surface space for soundbars.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose incredible elements made the LG C2 our pick for the best TV we've ever tested. With the C2, you can turn any room in your house into a home theater. See the screen yourself before the deal powers down.\u00a0\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

Maybe there's an aroma of last night's dinner lingering in the kitchen or your living room has a bit of pet hair or dust\u00a0swirling about. Whatever the case, Coway Airmega air purifiers can help clear things up and you can get three different models on sale with an exclusive discount just for our readers.\u00a0\nThrough\u00a0Thursday, September 22, members of our Perks and Rec newsletter can use the promo code USAT25\u00a0to get 25% off the Coway Airmega 150, 250 and 250S air purifiers. This is one of the many deal opportunities available through the End-of-Summer Stealsfest running now through this Thursday. With the Coway discount, the compact 150 goes from its list price of $189.99 down to $142.50, the 250 is down from $399 to $299.25 and the smart tech-friendly 250S drops from $449 to $336.75.\nCoway says the Airmega 150 is best for smaller spaces, specifically 214 square feet. The 150 features three-stage filtration technology that first captures large particles like dust and pet hair, then harmful odors from pets and foods before trapping ultra-fine particles like mold and pollen. It has an easy touch display with an air quality indicator, an Auto mode that adjusts its fan when needed and indicators when the filter needs replacing.\u00a0\nFor larger spaces, there are the 250 and 250S. Both purifiers feature four filters, the newer one specifically captures and deactivates smaller particles in the air. They also have a Smart mode feature that helps it automatically adapts to its surroundings by adjusting air speeds based on air quality, so you can keep your airflow clean without ramping up your energy bill. The x-factor of the 250S is its Wi-Fi technology and compatibility with the Coway mobile app.\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

This fall, the retailer will likely drop huge price cuts leading up to Black Friday 2022, which takes place on Friday, November 25.\u00a0\nWhile Walmart's sales offer great opportunities\u00a0to score must-have products for less, the retailer routinely offers massive markdowns in its clearance section. On any given day, you can find rollbacks on tech, home goods, kitchen products and more.\u00a0\nWalmart sales typically last anywhere from a few days to a week. Some Walmart deals, however, sell out quick, so you may only have a few hours to scoop the savings. If you want the\u00a0best chance at shopping the most popular Walmart deals, consider signing up for Walmart+, the retailer's premium subscription service.\u00a0Being a member of Walmart+ gets you exclusive access to the retailer's sale events, some of which are for subscribers only. You can even get early access to Black Friday deals, free unlimited delivery for orders and cheaper\u00a0members-only gas prices.\u00a0A Walmart+ membership also includes a Paramount+ Essential Plan, offering members the ability to stream premium entertainment like Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,\u00a0Sonic the Hedgehog 2\u00a0and even live sports\u00a0for a full year.\nWhile details on Walmart's Black Friday 2022 sale are still under lock and key, we expect the retailer to begin offering\u00a0early Black Friday deals in November. Last year, Walmart released\u00a0several Black Friday ads in the weeks leading up to the shopping extravaganza, holding a month-long Black Friday Deals for Days event in November 2021.\u00a0\nExact deals have yet to be released, but if Walmart's sale is anything like last year, you can expect to see tons of deals on smart tech, home goods, kitchen gadgets and more this Black Friday 2022.

And here at Reviewed, we\u2019ve tested a lot of pillows in our quest to recommend only the best.Think of us as the experts who help you buy products you\u2019ll love, like our Best Value winner, the Beckham Hotel gel pillows.

Sign up for text message alerts from the experts at Reviewed.\nOur testers loved the Beckham Hotel pillows, finding that they didn\u2019t show signs of wear over time, laundered well, and resisted overnight weight and pressure. But while the pillows were cushioning for most sleeping positions and weights, they didn\u2019t provide sufficient loft for some side sleepers with broader shoulders and builds. Likewise, stomach and back sleepers may find the pillows prop them up too much.\u00a0\nThe Beckham Hotel gel pillows set on Amazon comes with two pillows, meaning it\u2019s about $15.96 per pillow. They\u2019re filled with gel memory foam, so they\u2019ll have that almost \u201csink-in\u201d sensation that memory foam is famous for. They come in two sizes, queen and king. While the queen is currently on sale, the king set goes for $34.92.\u00a0\nEnd-of-Summer Stealsfest kicks off Sept. 18.

From the home chef\u00a0to the music lover to the neat freak, we have you covered. Here are Reviewed's picks for the gifts women want\u00a0in 2022, including some of the best stuff we've tested, top-rated items and things our editors own, love and recommend. To make sure you find a gift within your price range, you can jump right to the section that fits your budget:\nPajamas are always a great gift because, after all,\u00a0we wear them every night!\u00a0The Ekouaer PJ Set\u00a0is a popular set on Amazon with over 11,000 reviews and a 4.5 rating. The set is available in sizes XS-XXL with a whopping 45 color and printed options ranging from solid black to festive holiday patterns. The viscose fabric\u00a0is so soft, stretchy and comfy, she may never take them off.\nWinc\u00a0is one of our favorite wine subscriptions and allows your giftee to become an unofficial sommelier from their\u00a0living room. All they have to do is fill out a simple questionnaire and Winc will deliver a four-bottle box monthly according to their tastes\u2014there are even vegan options available! You can easily gift them a gift card to help them get started. There's also no commitment required so they can pause or cancel their membership at any time.\u00a0\nIf you ever get stumped on what to give\u00a0your beauty-loving wife, sister, girlfriend, mom or friend, try one of our\u00a0favorite beauty subscription boxes, The\u00a0Allure Beauty Box. Starting at just $19 per month, she'll receive a wide variety of full-size and sample-size makeup and skincare products from high-end, drugstore and indie brands.\u00a0\nIf she's always complaining about how hectic her week has been, she'll love our favorite set of bath bombs to have a long soak with. The top-rated LifeAround2Angels Bath Bombs Set comes with 12 fizzy, colorful and moisturizing bombs and has more than 40,000\u00a0overwhelmingly positive reviews on Amazon, with many claiming they're just good as the more expensive Lush bath bombs.\u00a0We even loved their pleasant scents and how they didn't stain our bathtubs as most other bath bombs do.\u00a0\nNothing says \"thoughtful gift\"\u00a0more than a book of meaningful photographs.\u00a0Shutterfly is our favorite online photo printing service at Reviewed. We love its\u00a0high-quality prints and the wide variety of photo-themed gift options that are available, including photo books. For high-end wedding and baby albums, modern custom calendars\u00a0and frames, Artifact Uprising is also incredible.\u00a0\nFor those who have busy schedules and order more takeout than they probably should, a meal kit delivery service would be an excellent gift idea. Our favorite meal kit delivery service is Home Chef, which offers\u00a0\u201chigh-quality ingredients, well-written recipes,\u00a0and fantastic flavors.\u201d If you\u2019re shopping for someone who enjoys home-cooked meals but lacks time in their week to prep and cook, give them the gift of easy weeknight dinners with a Home Chef gift card.\nIf you're shopping for someone who loves home d\u00e9cor, you can never go wrong with a trendy candle as a gift. We love the\u00a0Capri Blue Volcano Jar Candle at Reviewed. Not only does the scent smell amazing, but the chic jars\u00a0double as pretty home d\u00e9cor. Anthropologie sells tons of styles for\u00a0Capri Blue candles\u00a0to fit any aesthetic. They'll look perfect atop any\u00a0nightstand, bookshelf or mantel.\nFor the person who cherishes\u00a0memories, consider creating an\u00a0adorable piece of custom photo art that they can hang up on the wall\u00a0for all to see. Whether it's pictures of a newborn, snapshots of grandkids\u00a0or photos from college for a recent graduate, this Heart Snapshot\u00a0collage art is a sweet and sentimental gift they will truly appreciate.\nJewelry doesn't have to be too flashy or expensive to make a statement. Just take a look at the\u00a0One Heart Initial Necklace from Mint & Lily. Personalize this dainty necklace with two\u00a0initials and choose from 18K gold plated, 18K rose gold plated or silver. It's super sweet and she will love it.\nThe Sill is an online shop for both live plants and faux plants. If you're shopping for someone who loves greenery, a plant from The Sill would make a\u00a0great gift, whether they have a green thumb or not. Our editor\u00a0reviewed the service and\u00a0loved it for its wide range of plant types and sizes, as well as the economical prices.\nIf you\u2019re shopping for someone who's into makeup consider getting them\u00a0an accessory that enhances the experience of putting makeup on: a lighted makeup mirror! The Deweisn Tri-Fold Lighted Vanity Makeup Mirror is the best value makeup mirror\u00a0we tested, as it provides perfect views and lighting for optimal makeup application.\u00a0\nCorkcicle Insulated Stemless Wine Glass\u00a0is a perfect gift for wine drinkers. These cute little thermos will keep their drink cold during\u00a0outdoor gatherings on the beach, solo in their backyard or on the go.\u00a0It comes in a variety of colors, including one called \u201cUnicorn Magic.\u201d\u00a0\nIf they're a mom with multiple kids, always at work or just have a ton of responsibilities, chances are they're looking to de-stress after a long day. That's why an essential oil diffuser will make a great gift for her.\u00a0The\u00a0Airom\u00e9 Serenity Medium Diffuser\u00a0is\u00a0our favorite essential oil diffuser\u00a0and can run relaxing scents like lavender and eucalyptus for up to six hours. It's also fairly economical, so you can bundle it up with a few of their favorite scents.\nWhether she loves sipping on\u00a0the beach, by the campfire or on the sidelines, Br\u00fcmate's Hopsulator Slim Can Cooler will keep her favorite beverage nice and cold. The slim style is made to fit any 12 oz. slim can, so stock up on her favorite spiked seltzers to make the gift complete.\nThe Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer is consistently popular, almost always selling out. With more than\u00a0300,000\u00a0rave reviews on Amazon (yes, 300,000), it has achieved cult status in the world of beauty products\u2014and it's approved by our\u00a0beauty editor. She\u00a0tested the hairdryer and found that it absolutely does live\u00a0up to\u00a0the hype, especially if you want salon-quality hair from\u00a0home\u2014in half the time.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Ugg Clifton Backrest Pillow is perfect for the woman who likes to cozy up in bed with a good book (or her phone), as it offers plenty of cushioned support to leave her feeling comfortable for hours.\u00a0\nLeggings are a staple in every women's wardrobe and one can never have enough of them. We love lululemon's Align leggings at Reviewed. They are the most comfortable leggings many of us\u00a0have ever owned.\u00a0When buying these as a gift, pay attention to sizing, as you want to get the right pair. Make it a complete outfit by adding a coordinating Align Tank Top to your cart.\nThe FJ\u00c4LLR\u00c4VEN K\u00e5nken Water Resistant Backpack\u00a0is not only\u00a0trendy and useful (with hundreds of 5-star reviews on Nordstrom), but they are also functional and of high quality. The brand makes our favorite casual-use backpack out of all the ones we tested, so we can safely say this is a great gift. No matter their age, a backpack is always nice to have, for school, work, traveling and commuting.\nIf you\u2019re shopping for someone who enjoys cooking and loves Italian food, a pasta maker would make for a\u00a0fun gift. It\u2019s not just a gadget,\u00a0it\u2019s also an experience! How fun would it be to learn to make your own pasta in the comfort of your own kitchen?! Our favorite pasta maker at Reviewed is the Marcato Atlas 150 which was both easy to use and aced all our tests.\nThe Roku Ultra Streaming Device is our favorite streaming device for its easy-to-navigate interface and sleek remote which comes with a headphone jack in case your giftee has a roommate or significant other and loves to watch TV into the early hours of the morning. If you know someone who is addicted to binging television shows, give them the gift of an enhanced Netflix viewing experience.\nLa Mer is an expensive moisturizer with a cult following\u2014and also a perfect gift if you want to ball out on someone. La Mer Cr\u00e9me de la Mer moisturizing cream\u00a0has nearly\u00a037,000 hearts at Sephora and\u00a0more than\u00a06,300 reviews at Nordstrom with a 5-star rating. Nordstrom customers loved how refreshing and lightweight it was and how radiant it made their skin feel.\nYou can't go wrong with the gift of slippers\u2014especially a cozy pair like these. Not only are Ugg slippers and boots trendy again, but the Ugg Scuffette II Slippers are the best slippers we tested.\u00a0We loved them for their fluffy wool lining and all day comfort.\nYeti products have a cult following, and this popular water bottle would be a welcome\u00a0gift for anyone who is good or bad at staying hydrated (I am bad; I guess I need a Yeti Rambler). When we tested water bottles, the Yeti Rambler 26 Oz. Bottle was one of our top pick for the outdoors since it's durable, leak-proof and easy to grip on the move.\nMany people are still opting to exercise at home rather than at the gym or in fitness studios. If you\u2019d like to give the gift of a home gym upgrade, consider a yoga mat. Perfect for virtual fitness classes, ab work, stretching\u00a0and of course yoga, a yoga mat is a must. Even if they already own one, the lululemon 5mm mat would be a welcomed enhancement. The mat features a natural rubber base with just a little extra cushion for your body.\nThe\u00a0Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Lite Circle Cardigan\u00a0has more than 3,700 Nordstrom reviews and a 4.7-star rating. I own this myself and can confirm it is\u00a0actually a comfortable blanket disguised as clothing. When it comes to cardigans and sweaters, the limit does not exist for the amount one can own. They make great gifts\u2014especially when they\u2019re this cozy (and chic).\nYou can't go wrong with one of our favorite robes. The Parachute Classic Turkish Cotton Robe\u00a0is a unisex robe designed to fit all body types. We found the Turkish cotton to be very absorbent and great for wearing after showering. It's a comfortable, solid investment for her to wear for years to come.\nHailed as\u00a0our top pick for Fitbit devices, the\u00a0Fitbit Charge 5\u00a0is a serious game-changer.\u00a0 We loved its comprehensive fitness tracking, sleep tracking as well as built-in GPS. It's also super comfortable to wear so she can wear it on her wrist all day long.\u00a0Plus, she'll receive her calls and texts straight on her watch, making it easy to keep track of her social life even when she's on a run.\u00a0\nIf you're shopping for someone who loves listening to music or podcasts,\u00a0consider gifting the\u00a0JBL Flip 6\u00a0Portable Bluetooth Speaker.\u00a0It's the best value portable Bluetooth speaker we've tested, since it's both durable and waterproof, meaning it can be used anywhere, rain or shine.\u00a0A portable speaker is always great to have to bring on hikes or use at home, and they're especially great for outdoor gatherings.\nI thought I hated jeans until I discovered Madewell jeans. They\u2019re comfortable, they\u2019re slimming, they never rip\u00a0and they\u2019re a great price. Madewell also has sizes for all\u2014petite, tall and curvy.\u00a0If you're not sure what kind to get, we\u00a0recommend the Madewell\u00a0the Perfect Vintage Jean in Coffey Wash or a nice pair of some\u00a0curvy jeans. Read more about\u00a0why we're\u00a0obsessed with\u00a0Madewell jeans.\nPolaroid photos never go out of style, especially if she loves to decorate her scrapbook, diary or even bedroom wall with her favorite memories. Consider getting her the popular\u00a0Fujifilm Instax 11 Mini Instant Camera Bundle which Amazon shoppers say is easy to use and produces high-quality prints. You'll even be able to pick between multiple colors and gift her one that matches her style.\u00a0\nThe book lover in your life may already have a Kindle, but who doesn\u2019t enjoy the latest and greatest technology the world has to offer? The Kindle Paperwhite is the best we've tested as it features an amazing display, is glare-free\u00a0and waterproof.\nFor the past couple of years, Instant Pots have been all the rage for both advanced home chefs and beginners. What is an Instant Pot, you ask? It\u2019s a multi-cooker, meaning it does all the things. It\u2019s a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, yogurt maker, cake maker, egg cooker and the list goes on. If they don't yet have an Instant Pot (or they have an older model), consider giving them the best multi-cooker we've ever tested, the Instant Pot Ultra 6 Qt 10-in-1 Pressure Cooker which we loved for its versatility.\nBirkenstocks slowly made a\u00a0comeback over the last couple of years, and now they are once again a summer footwear staple. I own three pairs of Birkenstocks (see my review of them), and they are so comfortable that I no longer wear other shoes during summer. I recommend the Birkenstock Arizona Soft Footbed Sandal, as well as the less expensive Essentials Arizona waterproof slides. Both are fantastic.\nYou heard it from our staff at Reviewed first: The Always Pan is the\u00a0perfect gift. The influencer-approved kitchen item is not only stylish, but it does the job of eight pieces of cookware. It's a fry pan, saut\u00e9\u00a0pan, steamer, skillet, saucier, saucepan, non-stick pan, spatula\u00a0and spoon rest. Perfect for those who live in small spaces, the Always Pan is an ideal gift for anyone who loves\u00a0to cook.\u00a0\nDoubling as home decor and personal comfort, throw blankets are a great gift for everyone. For a splurge, Barefoot Dreams sells a Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Throw Blanket\u00a0that Chrissy Teigen once recommended as the gift to buy in a tweet (she owns one and claims to use it '365'). Another great option is\u00a0Anthropologie\u2019s Sophie Faux Fur Throw Blanket. For a less expensive blanket,\u00a0The Bliss Plush Throw is a wonderful option with a 4.8-star rating with more than 2,100\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200breviews.\nA new\u00a0wallet is a no-brainer gift for men and women alike\u2014and this one has a designer label to boot.\u00a0This\u00a0Michael Kors Tri-Fold Leather Wallet by Michael Kors comes in both soft pink and acorn shades, including the \u201cMichael Kors\u201d logo printed across its front. The back has a zipper pocket for additional storage, and the interior has room for all her cards, cash\u00a0and change.\u00a0\nFor anyone who loves sleeping in (or sleeping in general),\u00a0comfortable sheets are a must. No more tossing and turning in scratchy sheets because Tuft & Needle's Percale Sheet Set is made from 100% Supima cotton that is ultra smooth and only gets softer over time. These luxurious cooling sheets come\u00a0in five colors and seven mattress sizes. They are perfect for a hot sleeper and anyone who values a good night's rest.\nI have owned\u00a0Madewell's Zip Top Transport Leather Tote for a few years now and recommend it as a gift for any woman who is always on the go. The\u00a0classic tote is big enough to hold belongings for work and long weekends, and it's stylish enough to use even when there's not\u00a0a lot in it. It's especially great for traveling because of the zip-top\u2014and\u00a0the fact it fits way more than you would think. When we tested it, we found that it was the \"Goldilocks of bags\u2014not too small, not too big, but\u00a0just\u00a0right.\" The bag comes in a few different\u00a0colors, but the English Saddle color is the most popular.\nThe one who loves beauty products and having fabulous hair would love the GHD Curve Creative Curl Wand. When we tested curling irons, it\u00a0came out on top as our favorite. Our beauty editor said,\u00a0\"It's intuitive, heats up quickly\u00a0and makes the sometimes painstaking process of styling my hair all-around easier.\"\u00a0\nApple\u2019s AirPods Pro are the best true wireless earbuds for iPhones\u00a0our experts have ever tested. If you\u2019re shopping for a lover of all things Apple, they would adore a pair of these\u2014even if they already own the original AirPods. Who wouldn't love an upgrade?\u00a0For Zoom meetings, working out\u00a0and even listening to podcasts while loading and unloading the dishwasher, AirPods, along with a pretty new case,\u00a0make a great gift. Not to mention, they feature active noise cancelation, an upgraded comfortable design and a new transparency mode if your giftee needs to tune into their surroundings.\u00a0\nWe love robot vacuums at Reviewed and so do our readers. In fact, one of the things our readers continue to buy over and over\u00a0is robot vacuums. The eufy BoostIQ 11S Robot Vacuum Cleaner\u00a0is the best affordable robot vacuum we\u2019ve ever tested, thanks to its slim design and efficient dirt pickup,\u00a0and would make a great gift for anyone, whether they enjoy cleaning or not. If you're willing to shell out some extra dollars, consider the best robot vacuum we\u2019ve ever tested, the iRobot Roomba j7+. No matter what your budget is, a robot vacuum is always a good choice.\nAir fryers have been one of the trendiest kitchen gadgets for a while now, as they offer\u00a0a way to make home-cooked fried food that\u2019s healthier than regular fried food. Philips Air Fryer XXL is the best air fryer we tested and would make a great gift for anyone who likes to cook and\u00a0eat semi-healthy, and of course, has extra kitchen counter space. From frozen fries to hamburgers to Nashville hot chicken,\u00a0this gadget could handle it all.\u00a0\nWeighted blankets are great\u2014and not just because they\u2019re warm, but because they can help you relax. The best-weighted blanket we tested is the ultra-popular Gravity Blanket. Gravity claims their blanket is like wearing a hug. If you're shopping for someone who could use a hug or another blanket to lounge on the couch with, consider getting them this blanket. It's great to sleep with at night, too.\nGo ahead and spoil her with a Tory Burch handbag, she deserves it! The Kira Quilted Square Crossbody purse is perfect for a date night or to show off to her girlfriends. It's made from a luxuriously\u00a0soft leather and features a gold chain strap that can be worn over the body doubled to wear on the should for ultimate versatility.\nIf your giftee has been looking for ways to explore new worlds or get out of their own head, the Oculus Quest 2 might be the move. The console comes with 128GB of storage and the VR headset is equipped with an optimized display, capturing 50% more pixels than the original Quest model.\u00a0\nAfter testing running watches, the\u00a0Garmin Forerunner 245 Running Watch took the top spot as the best one\u00a0as it was both comfortable for all-day wear and offered a robust set of fitness tracking features. Whether the person you're shopping for Is training for their 10th marathon or just casually enjoys running, this watch would be welcomed with open arms\u2014I mean wrists.\u00a0\nIf they don't own one already, an Apple Watch would be a fantastic gift for the one who is always on their iPhone. We tested the popular Apple Watch Series 7\u00a0and it is the best smartwatch we've ever tried, thanks to its stellar fitness tracking and\u00a0blood oxygen sensor and larger display.\u00a0Give\u00a0the gift of our favorite smartwatch\u00a0so they can have all of their\u00a0notifications, music and texts at their\u00a0fingertips all the time.\nA good Dutch oven is a kitchen staple and our\u00a0favorite\u00a0overall was this Staub Cast Iron 5.5 Quart Round Cocotte which was great at both braising meat and simmering stews.\u00a0We're not the only ones loving this brand, either. The\u00a0cookware is all over food blogs and Instagram. Clearly, these Dutch ovens are hot right now, so get one for the person in your life who loves cooking.\nIf you're looking to splurge, The MYX II\u00a0by\u00a0Myxfitness is truly an amazing gift if you're shopping for someone who loves spinning. We tested exercise bikes and found this model to be the best value pick. This bike comes with a Polar heart rate monitor visible on the screen that lets you hit three exertion zones. Unlike Peloton, the goal isn't RPMs (revolutions per minute of the flywheel), it's adjusting resistance so you hit your targetted heartrate. The display can also swivel any way you giftee\u00a0wants as well, so they can take non-spinning classes like HIIT and barre too! Do note though classes are all on-demand, which might not be ideal if your giftee loves live classes.\nIf you're looking to splurge on someone who lives in a place where temperatures plummet to below freezing, a Canada Goose Shelburne Genuine Coyote Fur Trim Down Parka is a great choice.\u00a0Yes, they are expensive, but we\u00a0can confirm that they are worth the price. The\u00a0Canada Goose Ellison Packable Down Jacket\u00a0is another popular option at a more affordable price.\nThere\u2019s a lot more where this came from.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Water damage can be costly, and you can give yourself one less thing to worry about by installing a smart water leak detector to keep tabs on possible\u00a0leaks and moisture problems in your home.\nNot sure what that is? We'll tell you.\nAn app-controlled water leak detector, like\u00a0the Moen Flo,\u00a0the best water leak detector the Reviewed experts have\u00a0ever tested, means that you'll always be in the know when water leaks or excessive moisture are found in your home.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\nKids are back in school and the days are getting shorter, so it's just about time to start thinking about how you will decorate the outside of your house for Halloween.\nThere\u2019s a lot more where this came from. Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\nHalloween inflatables are a popular option and an easy way to add some spook to your stoop. But, if you've been hesitant to click the buy button because you're not sure how the giant air-filled pieces of fabric will hold up to the weather or rambunctious kids\u2014or both\u2014we've got you covered.\nWe tested three Halloween inflatables from popular retailers, like Walmart and Lowe's, to see if they're as great as they look online and just how well they stand up (literally) to both the elements and elementary school children. But that's not all: Below, you'll also find five of the best inflatables you can get right now whether you want something scary or nostalgic!\nI definitely got some strange looks from our neighbors when I filled our front yard with four giant Halloween inflatables in the middle of August, but that's par for the course when one works for Reviewed.\nI attached each inflatable to a heavy duty extension cord that was plugged into one of our outdoor power outlets. I then timed how long it took each spooky decoration to inflate before securing them to the front lawn via the included tethers and stakes.\nOriginally, I planned to test how each inflatable stood up to strong wind by using a leaf blower, but it ended up being a really windy day here in Los Angeles, so nature did that test for me.\nLastly, I sprayed each inflatable with water to mimic a rain shower, then had my kids pummel each of the blow-ups repeatedly to see just how much damage four small fists can do.\nThere's likely a safety-related reason for the cords being so short, but whatever the cause, it's super annoying.\nI assume that most people's outdoor outlets are attached to the side of their house, just like mine is, which means that you'll need a long, heavy-duty extension cord if you want to place your inflatables in the middle of your front lawn.\u00a0\nI initially tried to put up the inflatables solo, but quickly realized that I needed help to keep them steady while securing them to the grass. I recruited my mom to help, but it's worth planning your installation for a time when you'll have a second set of adult hands around.\nSecuring the inflatables to your lawn requires using a set of tethers that clip onto the sides of each spooky character. These tethers then get attached to stakes that get inserted into your lawn.\nFor the inflatables to stay upright, the tethers have to be stretched out pretty far, which can turn your lawn into an obstacle course of hard-to-see ropes that kids can easily trip over. My kids fell over them in broad daylight, so I'm concerned about trick-or-treaters doing a face plant on Halloween night (and their parents suing me).\u00a0\nThis is my 7-year-old daughter's personal favorite choice among the Halloween inflatables on sale at Walmart. If you have a kid who wants dramatic seasonal d\u00e9cor but who doesn't want anything scary, this adorable decoration hits just the right note.\nOne of the best things about the Double Bubble Witches Cauldron is how quickly it inflates: It took just 36.33 seconds from box to blow up. Standing at 6 feet high and 4 feet wide, it makes a statement without being overwhelming, and my daughter loved pretending to help stir the witches' brew.\nThis Walmart Halloween inflatable also scores points for the fact that it is the only inflatable of the bunch that comes with enough stakes and tethers to keep it from blowing over in a strong wind.\nAnother plus for The Double Bubble Witches Cauldron is that it looks better IRL than it does online, which was a pleasant surprise when we set it up. Plus, it withstood quite a few bouts of my 8-year-old son trying to strangle the witches and my daughter's repeated \"stirs\" of the cauldron.\nOur only complaint is that the frog the taller witch holds doesn't have a light inside of it\u2014unlike both the witches and the cauldron\u2014so you can't see the frog at night.\nIf you want a Halloween inflatable that won't scare the neighborhood toddlers, get the Gemmy Double Bubble Witches Cauldron ASAP.\u00a0\nFor truly dramatic Halloween d\u00e9cor, the best bang for your buck comes in the size of 12-foot-tall inflatables. There's definitely something spooky about a massive, creepy black tree looming over you\u2014an effect that's likely multiplied when you're only a 4-foot-tall child. My kids go nuts for scary d\u00e9cor, and this giant LED black tree definitely delivers.\nThe feature that sets this particular Home Depot Halloween inflatable apart is that the face contains green LED lights that flash on and off. There are lights inside the hands as well.\nWe all loved how the tree bends slightly forward and backward in the wind, giving it an especially creepy effect. After testing it out, we decided that it would be fun to put it right on the border of the sidewalk so that it could bow back and forth over the heads of unsuspecting trick-or-treaters\u2014talk about a spook factor!\nThe Giant-Sized Lightshow LED Black Tree comes with a set of metal stakes that slip through plastic \"legs\" on the base of the tree and get inserted into the ground, as well as a set of tethers and plastic stakes. While it feels like that should have been enough to keep it from blowing over, the strong wind meant that the stakes in the base of the inflatable kept coming out of the lawn.\nWe eventually had to tie it down with a rope and an additional stake to keep it from blowing over, so you'll need to improvise if you don't want to spend your Halloween constantly propping this tree back up.\nWhile the Joiedomi Lighted Ghost Inflatable Greeter looks purple on the Lowe's website, it's a true, traditional white ghost. Overall, the website photos don't do it justice: It's even creepier in person, and it has spooky tattered muslin fabric scraps hanging off of both arms, which aren't visible online.\nAt 6 feet tall, the Joiedomi Lighted Ghost Inflatable Greeter is a great option if you don't have space for a 12-foot-tall Halloween inflatable. It still offers plenty of scare factor, but the shorter height means it's less terrifying for younger trick-or-treaters, and it can even be used on an apartment balcony if there's a way to tie it to something.\nOur favorite feature of this Lowe's Halloween inflatable is the LED lights that swirl around inside it. They provide a nice creepy effect while offering plenty of illumination for dark October evenings. The Lighted Ghost withstood our wind test without falling over, and from an aesthetic standpoint, I appreciate that it comes with white tethers.\nIt also wasn't knocked over by my simulated rain storm, but the netting did get soggy and dirty, and it wasn't easy to clean.\nUnfortunately, we do have a few complaints about the Ghost Inflatable Greeter. It takes almost a full minute to inflate fully, and the nylon fabric doesn't feel as thick or durable as most other inflatables.\nAfter just two punches from my 8-year-old, one of the plastic pieces covering an air hole popped off and was lost forever. While it doesn't seem to have negatively impacted the performance of the Ghost Inflatable Greeter, it does make me question whether this inflatable would last for longer than one Halloween.\nNote: The exact model we tested isn\u2019t currently available but this similar model is available right now. This Joiedomi Lighted Ghost Inflatable Greeter is taller at 12 feet, but is also a traditional white ghost inflatable with the same LED lights swirling inside it and the same tattered muslin fabric scraps hanging off its arms. The only difference is the pointed head and the expression, which we daresay, is a little creepier than the one tested.\u00a0\nThis 8-foot-tall Halloween inflatable looked so cute online that I had lofty aspirations of setting it up at the end of our walkway for trick-or-treaters to run through on their way to our front door. Unfortunately, it was impossible to get this inflatable to stand up.\nIt comes with four tethers and four stakes, but no matter how we positioned them, the archway fell over. Granted, it was a windy day when we set it up but considering that it is supposed to be designed for outdoor use, it seems ridiculous that it can't withstand basic fall weather conditions.\nWe eventually salvaged the Ghosts Spider Archway by tying the tethers to the columns on our front porch, but it wasn't as dramatic and fun as it could've been had we been able to get it to stand up in our yard. We all agree that this was an inflatable that was better in concept than execution.\nOn the positive side, this Halloween inflatable's nylon is thick and feels sturdy. It looks exactly as it is pictured on Amazon. It took less than a minute to fully inflate, which I thought was relatively fast considering the shape of the archway and the attached figures.\nIt fared fine in my simulated rain shower, though I didn't test to see if the water would make it fall over because it had already capsized and could not right itself.\nIf you're dead set on adding an archway to your collection of Halloween inflatables, the BZB Goods Halloween Inflatable Ghosts Spider Archway is definitely cute, but you'll need to figure out an alternative method for keeping it upright.\n\u25baReviewed End-of-Summer Stealsfest:\u00a0Save hundreds with exclusive deals on Madewell, Solo Stove and iRobot\n\u25baLast chance:\u00a0Score Disney+ for only $1.99 and stream 'Pinocchio' and 'She-Hulk' now\nThis Costway Pumpkins Patch Outdoor Halloween Yard Inflatable is lively and bright!

To skip that hassle, a robot vacuum keeps your floors fresh without you having to lift a finger and iRobot makes some of the best of the best. For a limited time, shoppers can get select models of these quality robot vacuums at Woot for a helpful price cut with our\u00a0exclusive discount code.\u00a0\nAs part of the End-of-Summer Stealsfest event, subscribers to Reviewed's Perks and Rec newsletter can use the coupon code USATODAY to get 25% off select iRobot Roomba models at Amazon's offshoot retailer. This is one of many amazing deals being offered to newsletter members from\u00a0today, September 18\u00a0through\u00a0Thursday, September 22. With this particular offer, you can get the advanced smart tech and strong suction power of iRobot robot vacuums for prices much easier on your budget.\n\u25baDisney+ deal: Get your first month of Disney+ for $1.99 and stream 'Pinocchio' and 'She-Hulk'\n\u25baWalmart+: Sign up for 30 days free and get free grocery deliveries, streaming and more\nOne of the best of the bunch is the Roomba i7+, typically listed for $533.59. With the subscriber-only coupon code, you can get the refurbished\u00a0vacuum and the dirt tower for $400.19.\u00a0The i7+ is one of\u00a0our top picks for the\u00a0best robot vacuums we've ever tested, having impressed us with its convenient self-emptying ability and strong suction power. During our testing, the i7+ picked up an average of 10.5\u00a0grams of dirt on hardwood floors and carpets, on par with a light manual cleaning from a regular-sized vacuum. Any dirt is collected by the vacuum's dirt tower attached to its charging station, keeping it in a sealed bag inside the tower\u00a0to be\u00a0emptied when full without users ever having to touch or smell what was vacuumed up.\nFor something even more affordable, there's the iRobot Roomba i3+ available in refurbished form\u00a0for $280.13. Typically listed for $373.51, the coupon code will bring the price down by more than $90.\u00a0We ranked the i3+ among the best Roombas we've ever tested\u00a0for having a similar\u00a0dirt pickup as\u00a0the i7+, along with the same self-emptying dirt tower. While the i7+ has more dirt disposal bags and an extra side brush, the i3+\u00a0has a cleaner look than other more expensive models with a textured grey top compared to the standard black. After a few weeks of letting the vacuum roam around floors, we found the i3+ looked cleaner and less scuffed than other models. So no matter how much dirt or debris it has to grab, it'll look like a stylish addition to your home.\u00a0\nWith the holidays approaching,\u00a0these deals are perfectly timed to start prepping your own space\u2014or getting a head start on gift-giving.\u00a0If you want to get a jump on your big seasonal spending without breaking the bank, these exclusive discounts are unmissable.\u00a0\nGet expert shopping advice delivered to your phone.\u00a0Sign up for\u00a0text message alerts\u00a0from the deal-hunting nerds at Reviewed.\nThe product experts at\u00a0Reviewed\u00a0have all your shopping needs covered.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\u00a0\nToday, September 18th, is\u00a0National Cheeseburger Day\u2014a day to celebrate the juicy, cheese-laden sandwich that Americans love so dearly.\u00a0The story of how the classic sandwich came to be is a little murky, but one enduring story is that a teenage fry cook named Lionel Clark Sternberger put a slice of American cheese on a meat patty while working in his father's sandwich shop just to see what it would taste like. And the rest, as they say, is history. \u00a0\nMany restaurants are serving up juicy deals\u2014and even freebies\u2014for the occasion, but we\u2019re here to help you take your cheeseburgers to the next level right at home. Whether you like your burgers topped with sizzling bacon or fresh tomato slices, here are the tools to make the perfect cheeseburger today and any day.\u00a0\n\u25baReviewed End-of-Summer Stealsfest:\u00a0Save hundreds with exclusive deals on Madewell, Solo Stove and iRobot\nSure, you can\u00a0buy buns and patties from the grocery store if you're looking for a convenient, no-frills cooking experience.\u00a0But if we're being honest, making a burger for National Cheeseburger Day is asking for frills. A stand mixer such as the KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart is a trusty companion when it comes to making your own patties. Using the meat grinder attachment, you can make your own ground beef easily and season it to your liking. After that, swap the meat grinder attachment for the dough hook to knead your own bread for homemade buns. \u00a0\nIf you're vegetarian, vegan or someone who is simply\u00a0conscious about\u00a0the sustainability of the meat industry, consider grilling a Beyond Burger for National Cheeseburger Day. Beyond is a plant-based substitute that mimics the texture, smell and taste of the real thing with extreme accuracy. Even people who eat real meat regularly and aren\u2019t generally fans of meat substitutes tend to be fans of that from Beyond. Trust us, you\u2019ll want to see what all the hubbub is about. \u00a0\nThe transitional time between summer and fall is the perfect time to break out the grill. The smoky taste from charcoal grilling is sure to elevate your burgers. We recommend going with the Napoleon NK22K-LEG-2 which we found to be the best charcoal grill thanks to its even heat distribution, sturdiness and impressive cook surface which can fit up to 13 burgers. As for the charcoal itself, the best briquette is Kingsford, which is widely available and\u00a0burns hotter than the competition.\u00a0If you prefer the convenience of a gas grill, we recommend using the Weber Spirit II E-310 which boasts impressive heat and an even, perfect sear.\u00a0\nEven if your home can\u2019t accommodate a grill, you can still experience the delectable joy of homemade cheeseburgers. One way to grill indoors is by using a cast-iron skillet over a burner. Its incredible heat-retention will cook your burgers evenly and the enduring seasoning of the pan from consistent use will give your burgers even more flavor. The best cast-iron skillet we've tested is the 12-inch skillet offered by Lodge thanks to its light weight, affordable price and heat-retention that blew the competition away. \u00a0\nThere\u2019s also the option to use an indoor grill which requires minimal flipping to get a perfect texture on both sides. We found the Cuisinart Griddler Deluxe to be the best indoor grill. While expensive, it browns quickly, is easy to use and the plates can be popped out to go in the dishwasher.\u00a0\nSmashed burgers, or Smashburgers, as popular food chains like to call them, use a technique of flattening the burgers to improve the flavor profile.\u00a0 If you want to make your own smashed burgers at home, you can\u00a0do so easily with Cuisinart's meat pressing set. While all you really need is the press itself, the set comes with patty papers for easy clean-up and a straight-edge spatula for transporting and flipping your patties.\u00a0\nWhen cooking burgers, a spatula is a must. We found the Wusthof Gourmet Offset Slotted Spatula to be the best spatula because it slides under food easily, it's dishwasher-friendly and it has a sturdy handle.\u00a0For a grilling spatula specifically, it doesn't get any better than the OXO Good Grips 16\" Grilling Turner. It has a sharp, serrated edge for easy flipping and comes with the best tongs. \u00a0\nWhether you like your burgers well done or prefer rare, having it cooked properly throughout is vital. Your internal temperature for your burger will range from 120-125\u00baF for rare to 160-165\u00baF for well-done. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) deems any internal temperature below 160\u00baF to be unsafe for ground meat, but of course, many brave the risk for their ideal doneness. We found the ThermoWorks ThermoPop to be the best meat thermometer. This sleek thermometer measures meat temperature accurately and quickly.\nGood knives are essential to prepare cheeseburger topping classics and sides like lettuce, tomatoes, onions and potatoes for fries. For all your burger prep needs, we recommend the Mercer Culinary Genesis 6-Piece Forged Knife Block Set. It\u2019s our favorite knife set to buy on a budget. Despite its low price, it goes toe-to-toe with more expensive options in terms of performance and comes with a snazzy glass.\u00a0\nWhile you\u2019re at it, you should probably invest in a cutting board for your burger prep. The Totally Bamboo Kauai Cutting Board is the best board because of its sustainability, durability and ease of cleaning. Not to mention, it's absolutely gorgeous.\u00a0\nFor crispy yet healthy fries and perfectly toasted buns, consider using an air fryer. Thanks to the power of convection, you can make French fries without calorie-dense oils. If you want, you can even use leftover cheese from your burger to make melty cheese fries. We found the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL to the best air fryer. It boasts a huge cooking capacity that can't be matched and everything it cooks seems to come out consistently delicious and crispy.\u00a0\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

This may be common in many cultures or societies, but co-sleeping can be hazardous for infants, experts say.\nThere's a risk of an infant suffocating when an adult rolls over on them or covers them up. Risks of sleep-related infant deaths increase five to 10 times when an infant under the age of four months of age sleeps on the same surface with someone else, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nAbout\u00a03,500 infants die each year in the U.S. from sleep-related\u00a0deaths, the academy says.\u00a0The AAP recommends that parents sleep in the same room \u2013 but not in the same bed as a baby, preferably for at least the first six months.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know that many parents choose to share a bed with a child, for instance, perhaps to help with breastfeeding or because of a cultural preference or a belief that it is safe,\" said Dr. Rebecca Carlin,\u00a0who co-authored the academy's Safe Sleep Recommendations, released in June 2022. \"The evidence is clear that this significantly raises the risk of a baby\u2019s injury or death, however, and for that reason AAP cannot support bed-sharing under any circumstances.\u201d\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\nThose safe infant sleep recommendations were\u00a0released just a week after the Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price issued\u00a0a warning to parents on not using infant rockers for sleeping.\nAt least 13 infant deaths have been reported in Fisher-Price Infant-to-Toddler Rockers and Newborn-to-Toddler Rockers between 2009 and 2021,\u00a0the company and agency said in a joint statement in June.

It's a reality that makes the already-complicated grieving process even more difficult. But choosing to\u00a0fixate only on their good traits, while ignoring the bad, provides an inaccurate representation of their humanity, experts say.\u00a0\nThe lines of inappropriate and appropriate conversations about deceased figures' lives are often blurred and unacknowledged. David Kessler, a grief specialist and founder of Grief.com, says our culture, once fixated on depicting the deceased as angelic beings incapable of wrong, is now changing.\n\"There's a movement shifting away from, 'don't talk badly about the dead,' to 'let's talk about people more authentically.' And these more authentic conversations include acknowledgement of both the good and bad in all of us,'\" Kessler says, adding that it exemplifies the complexity of humankind.\u00a0\nTo read Jenna's full story, click here.\nOur Queen Elizabeth II coverage\u00a0wasn't the only story to touch on grief this week. My colleague David Oliver had an exclusive chat with CNN's Anderson Cooper about his new podcast \"All There Is with Anderson Cooper\" (streaming now;\u00a0new episodes dropping weekly), which focuses on Cooper's own\u00a0grief journey.\nThe podcast grew out of the harrowing-but-healing process of going through his mother\u00a0Gloria Vanderbilt's\u00a0possessions after her death, the veteran journalist told David.\n\"If I don't write them down or preserve them, they'll just disappear and it'll be like the people who lived disappeared and never existed,\" Cooper says. \"And that's one of the hard things also about going through a person's things is, these are the last tangible memories and pieces of that person and to try to figure out what to do with them and how much \u2013 they have a lot of weight to them in many ways.\"\nOn the podcast, listeners will hear the voices of the late Vanderbilt and guests including Stephen Colbert, Molly Shannon and artist Laurie Anderson. And, of course, Cooper.\nTo learn more about the podcast and read more of David's interview, click here.\nAre you in the online dating game? It can be \"challenging, discouraging or simply horrible,\" writes Millennial Therapist Sara Kuburic in this week's column.\u00a0So, in order to\u00a0find a match, some users begin to widen their preferences.\nBut is this a good thing?\u00a0It depends, Sara says.

Unable to be seen in a timely manner, patients were directed to the ER.\nFollow-up after an ER visit is a critical but often overlooked part of a patient's ER visit. Doctors are forced to rush this process because another patient needs the bed, and patients are eager to go home after their visit which likely included a multi-hour stay in the waiting room.\nKeep these key points in mind during and after your discharge from the ER \u2013 because you may need to come back.\nIn\u00a0case you missed:The dos and don'ts of going to the ER\nGood tips:How to 'summer-proof' your child and keep them safe this season\nBe sure to ask your doctor for a printed copy of all your laboratory results and diagnostic imaging like X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Also ask for the images to be placed on a CD.\u00a0\nBear in mind most hospitals and health systems now provide an app or website where you can log in and view the results of your visit. But don't assume that your doctor's office will have access to your results automatically. The electronic medical record (EMR)\u00a0is very fragmented in the U.S.;\u00a0 there are multiple EMR systems and platforms don't always sync well\u00a0with each other.\nOver the last few\u00a0years , I've noticed that patients are getting more of their medical care in the ER than actually at their primary care doctor's office. Unfortunately, that outcome is fraught with a lot of opportunity for poly-pharmacy:\u00a0multiple ER doctors changing or adding new medications that could overlap and cause dangerous side effects. This is particularly true with medications for high blood pressure and diabetes.\u00a0\nPlease ask your ER doctor to review all your current medications and supplements. Larger hospitals \u00a0may have a dedicated ER pharmacist on hand who can help review your medication list as well.\nA lot of doctors will habitually tell patients to \"follow up with your primary doc\" but neglect to specify the timeframe or urgency to do so. We often tell patients to follow up for specific reasons,\u00a0whether to repeat an abnormal blood test, obtain a referral for a specialist\u00a0or for a timely wellness check. Please clarify with your ER doctor if there's an urgent need for follow up or if you can wait for your annual follow-up visit.\nRemember that a followup visit is also a great opportunity to get your vaccine record organized.\nHeads up:Don't fall behind on these important wellness checks\nTrack your vax:Why it's more important than ever to take ownership of your vaccinations\nAsk your ER doctor which signs and symptoms you should watch out for to signify that your condition is getting worse or not responding to outpatient treatment and warrants a return.\u00a0\nFor example, for common infections like cellulitis, pneumonia or pyelonephritis, we\u00a0 wonder\u00a0whether to admit a patient for intravenous antibiotics or discharge home with oral antibiotics. Using \"shared decision-making,\" we involve the patient in this discussion, taking into account their personal factors like caregiving responsibilities, their job, pets and whether they can responsibly treat their condition outside of the hospital.\nSometimes due to the nature of the disease\u00a0they don't improve at home. Such signs of a worsening infection warranting a return to the ER include continued fever despite antibiotics, uncontrollable vomiting preventing patients from taking oral antibiotics and altered mental status.\nMichael Daignault, MD, is a board-certified ER doctor in Los Angeles.

They looked at three patterns of stress: baseline levels, stress levels over a 14-week period, and how much these stress levels changed or fluctuated.\nOnce the babies were born and reached 3 months old, researchers also asked the mothers questions about how often babies showed distress, including crying and fussing.\nThe team discovered that babies born to mothers with fluctuating stress levels during pregnancy showed more negative emotions, though\u00a0they did not\u00a0find differences in stress patterns before and during the pandemic.\nRoe v.

But stress levels fluctuate.\n\"Maybe today, I'm good.

The study needs to be replicated in a larger and more representative sample, she said.\nAnother limitation is that researchers didn't have\u00a0daily assessments of the mothers' stress once the babies were born, only during pregnancy.\u00a0\n\"We could not control for stress lability/fluctuations in the postpartum period,\" MacNeill said.\u00a0\"So right now, we cannot say that stress during pregnancy\u00a0caused\u00a0higher levels of negative emotion in babies \u2013 just that there was a positive association between fluctuations in prenatal stress and infant negative emotions.\"\nHer hope is that future studies look at mothers' stress fluctuations both before and after childbirth.\nGeriatric pregnancy:'It's Not a 25-Year-Old\u2019s Game Anymore': An OB-GYN on Getting Pregnant After 35\nDespite the team not finding differences between stress levels before and after the pandemic, research has shown that pandemics like the coronavirus have increased stress in pregnant women,\u00a0MacNeill said.\nPrevious studies have also hinted at links between stress during pregnancy and infant emotions. One study published in 2009 suggested a correlation between\u00a0pregnancy-specific anxiety in mothers and\u00a0higher levels of fearfulness and sadness in their babies. Another, published in 2018, found a connection between\u00a0prenatal maternal hardships\u00a0\u2013 including food insecurity, bills and neighborhood stress\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and lower regulatory capacity scores among babies at 10 months old.\nTo cope with health crises like COVID-19 and the Zika virus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that pregnant individuals:\nThe organization also offered tips for health-care providers, including:\nWhile\u00a0MacNeill isn't a\u00a0clinician or interventionist, she said her team's results further highlight calls for better support among\u00a0pregnant individuals and their\u00a0families.\nIt's one thing to tell pregnant individuals \"be less stressed,\" but it's not particularly helpful for everyone, nor do they always want to hear that, she said.\n\"There need\u00a0to be greater supports kind of built into our health-care system and into policy that are, at the systemic level, supporting pregnant individuals and their families,\" she said.\nShe also noted that stress is normal, especially during pregnancy. Eliminating stress altogether likely isn't something that can be done, but there's help to give pregnant individuals the support they need.\n\"I think it's really not about telling individuals 'don't be stressed,' but rather making sure that we are creating a supportive environment for the pregnant person and\u00a0their family,\" she\u00a0\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Those changes might include swollen tissue, polyps or warning signs of cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic.\u00a0\nDuring a colonoscopy, a tube is inserted into a person\u2019s rectum, and a video camera on the tube allows a doctor to examine the colon. Sometimes, polyps or other tissue can be removed during the procedure, and biopsies can also be taken, if necessary.\u00a0\nColonoscopies can help find problems in your colon or be a step in treating a range of health issues, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.

The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics says parents could put their babies to bed when they are drowsy versus asleep, and not to rush them back to sleep if they wake up.\u00a0Pregnancy, Birth and Baby also suggests multiple ways to get babies back to bed.\u00a0\nAbout about 20%\u201330% of infants cry \"excessively and exhibit sleep difficulties\" for no known reason, the researchers said, and their goal was to provided an immediate solution for parents. More research is needed to determine if this method could improve sleep long-term, the team determined.\n\"Like science-based fitness training, we can do science-based parenting with these advances, and hopefully help babies to sleep and reduce parental stress caused by excessive infant crying,\" Kuroda said. \"We need science to understand a baby\u2019s behaviors, because they\u2019re much more complex and diverse than we thought.\"\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter:\u00a0@jordan_mendoza5.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/news/world/2022/09/13/baby-wont-stop-crying-how-to-get-them-to-sleep/10368278002/", "title": "The best way to get a crying baby back to sleep?

Your partner shouldn\u2019t be learning about their own relationship status from others or an Instagram post.\nTake a moment to process it\nBefore spreading the news, make sure you are in a place where you can handle it. Regardless of how supportive people may be, there will be at least one aunt or second cousin who inadvertently hurts your feelings. If nothing else, you will be bombarded with messages and questions. Check in with yourself: Are you ready for the attention, criticism\u00a0and people\u2019s reactions? Do you understand your narrative? Have you had any time to process and grieve? What boundaries do you want to set?\u00a0\nPlan who needs to know first\nMaybe you want to tell your family and close friends before you make it public. If you have kids, chances are\u00a0they should be among the first to know. Or, maybe, you don\u2019t want to bother with making it \u201cofficial\u201d and will start telling people casually when Christmas parties, weddings or graduation invitations come rolling in and you start to RSVP alone.\u00a0\nTo read the rest of her tips, click here.\nFor this week's advice column, a reader wrote in:\u00a0\"My mom and I have had a rocky relationship in the past, but it came to a head when my mom moved in with my husband and I a few years ago. She lost her job shortly after moving in, and stopped paying her rent but continued to go out with friends, travel, and get packages. When confronted, things didn't go well. After several explosive fights we finally asked her to leave. Everything was blamed on my husband because, according to her, he changed me when I married him. Therapy helped me learn that I've been suffering from narcissistic abuse and I now understand the boundaries needed to protect myself. \u00a0\nWe didn't have much contact with her after her eviction, but she pushed to see us soon after I gave birth to our first daughter. We were in this weird limbo where she pretended nothing happened, except she acted like my husband was invisible. This led to awkward visits and eventually we just stopped inviting her over. During this time, she got into the real estate business. We decided to sell our house and buy another, but went with another agent as I didn't really feel comfortable having my house sold by someone who acted as if my husband wasn't alive. I found out shortly after the sale that she had calculated exactly how much she would have made if we had hired her and was telling family members (mainly my siblings) that I had cheated her out of thousands of dollars. This didn't go over well.\nNow, my husband and I are ready to find a home in the country and things with my mom have slightly improved. It has been mentioned in passing that we may soon be selling again, and my mom automatically assumed that she would be our agent. I didn't have the guts to correct her and tell her we plan on using the same agent as last time. I know it won't go over well, but I don't feel comfortable using her when she still can't talk to my husband, and she fixated on how much money she felt we cheated her out of last time.

But, overall, more people globally are less healthy.

But those who are vegan or allergic to fish are advised to steer clear, and despite its anti-inflammatory effects, it isn't meant to treat active acne, but rather dehydrated or wounded skin.\u00a0\n\"For salmon pdrn to work, it needs to get across the top layer of the skin, meaning the skin needs to be broken,\" says Dr.\u00a0Rachel Ho, an aesthetic doctor based in Singapore.

Experts told me it's a\u00a0sign to check in with yourself.\u00a0\nSome may confuse quiet quitting with loafing, being lazy or not caring about work anymore. But Amy Morin, psychotherapist and editor-in-chief of Verywell Mind, says it's more about setting healthy boundaries to protect your mental health.\u00a0\n\"People are scaling back ... Saying here's what I'm willing to do, but here's also what I'm not willing to do,\" she says. \"It's about saying I value my personal life and I value my time off from work.\"\nIn this sense, she thinks we shouldn't look at it as a bad thing.\n\"Because when people are taking care of themselves outside the office, they're more productive while they're at the office,\" she adds.\nTo learn more (and for tips on maintaining a healthy work-life balance), click here.\nThis week my colleague Alia E. Dastagir dove into the controversial topic of sex education, particularly comprehensive sex ed and what it really means. Here's a snippet\u00a0of what she wrote:\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, sparking a conversation about which states teach students how to prevent pregnancy (never mind consent, boundaries or bodily autonomy). Opponents of sex ed are ramping up attacks, exploiting parental fears and accusing proponents of pushing education that introduces sexually inappropriate material to young kids too early, grooming them for abuse (studies show comprehensive sex ed reduces child sexual abuse). At the same time, the proliferation of \"Don't Say Gay\" bills further complicates sex ed in schools, eliminating the possibility of LGBTQ-inclusive education on topics critical to young people's health and well-being.\u00a0\nAdvocates see the attack on sex ed as backlash against an uptick in states implementing more robust sex ed across the country, a response in part to the conversations around consent catalyzed by #MeToo. In the last several years, more states have enacted state-based standards for comprehensive sex education and are implementing curricula that is not only comprehensive in terms of teaching medically accurate information, but is also responsive to LGBTQ youth, youth of color, youth with disabilities, that is trauma-informed, and that includes teaching on healthy relationships.\n\"Comprehensive sexuality education has to do with everything in the world that's connected meaningfully to issues of sex, gender and reproduction,\" says Deborah Roffman, a human sexuality educator and author of \"The Science of Babies: A Little Book for Big Questions About Bodies, Birth and Families.\" \"If you think deeply enough about that, that is everything in the world. We take this enormous subject and we pass it through a funnel to focus on sex.

Fans of \"Star Wars\" rarely get such an opportunity, but it makes sense that the most serious, grownup series\u00a0from the sci-fi franchise so far would be Disney+'s \"Andor,\" a prequel about Diego Luna's character from \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\"\u00a0\n\"Rogue One\" is among the darkest and gravest of the 11 \"Star Wars\" films, and\u00a0\"Andor\" (premiering Wednesday, then weekly, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0out of four) matches that tone and MPAA rating. It is its own story, one of Cassian Andor's (Luna) journey from man-on-the-run to rebel operative. It's an unembellished, taut TV show, with well-written characters and well-established stakes. In a lot of ways it doesn't feel like \"Star Wars\" at all, simply a very good science-fiction tale set on some far-off planets.\nThat might be a bug for some fans but it's also a feature: Unencumbered by the corporate synergy machine,\"Andor\" is not afraid of blood, gloom or sex. The series is\u00a0uniquely watchable among peers such as\u00a0\"The Mandalorian\" and \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" which must\u00a0hew much closer to fan service. In the crowded field of \"Star Wars\" TV, \"Andor\" is by far the best series yet.\u00a0\nMore:'Andor' star Genevieve O'Reilly spies AOC inspiration for 'Star Wars' leader Mon Mothma\nWe meet Andor five years before the events of \"Rogue One.\" He's a disheveled and often desperate man (and\u00a0sometime thief) who was separated from his people as a child. He lives on the salvage planet of Ferrix with his adoptive mother Maarva (Fiona Shaw, \"Killing Eve\") and has a flirtatious relationship with a local\u00a0fence\u00a0Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona).\u00a0In the premiere, Andor is\u00a0on the hunt for the little sister he lost after he was taken off his home planet, and he\u00a0journeys to a brothel (yes, there's a brothel in \"Star Wars\") on a corporate-controlled planet to find her.\nWhen the trip goes badly, he goes\u00a0on the run, and jumps into the open arms of Rebel Alliance leader\u00a0Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who needs a man to help with a heist. Cassian throws in with the rebels and\u00a0is simultaneously\u00a0pursued by several forces,\u00a0including severe\u00a0Imperial Security Bureau supervisor Dedra Meero (Denise Gough) and a low-level inspector on the corporate security ladder,\u00a0Syril Karn (Kyle Soller).\nHow to watch:'Andor'\nWhat makes \"Andor\" stand out\u00a0is its singular focus on character over spectacle. The series has plenty of action scenes and blaster battles, but it succeeds at giving emotion and stakes to every set piece. Luna is immensely appealing, as he was in \"Rogue One,\" creating likability and vulnerability in Andor, even though he makes many mistakes.\u00a0Even the series' villains are drawn with delicate, specific brushes rather than cartoonishly broad strokes. From the moment we meet Syril, an overeager, desperately power-hungry little man, we know exactly who he is, in all his weaselly, bratty glory.\u00a0\nThere is a propulsion to \"Andor\" that outruns (or outflies, since we're talking about space travel here) other Disney+ series, which have tended towards sleepier starts and plodding pacing. It's a smart case of form-follows-function that \"Andor\" is often as harried as its hero, whipping us around as we watch Cassian scramble for survival.\u00a0\nThe 10 best new TV shows this fall:'American Gigolo' to 'Andor'\nTV series set in the world of \"Star Wars,\" Marvel, DC Comics or any of the mega-franchises populating Hollywood these days come with a series of expectations and pressures. But we're a half-dozen or so \"Star Wars\" TV shows in now, and there is a (little) less pressure on each to be the be-all, end-all of the galaxy far, far away.\n\"Andor\" dances to its own thoughtful\u00a0tune, and if other \"Star Wars\" series can do the same, it portends a very good future for these shows.\u00a0\nAnd sure, they can have cute Baby Yodas too\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in moderation.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/entertainment/tv/2022/09/20/andor-disney-review-best-star-wars-series-yet/10390144002/", "title": "Review: Disney+'s 'Andor' is the best and most grown up 'Star Wars' series yet"}, {"authors": " Bryan Alexander", "date_publish": "Published: 4:02 p.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022 Updated: 10:43 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014\u00a0Raymond Lee plays a physicist on NBC's new version of \"Quantum Leap,\" but his theory-quoting character, Dr. Ben Song, seems worlds away from the nebbish stereotype.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014\u00a0Raymond Lee plays a physicist on NBC's new version of \"Quantum Leap,\" but his theory-quoting character, Dr. Ben Song, seems worlds away from the nebbish stereotype.\nThe first sign\u00a0is his\u00a0slamming 1970s wardrobe, a funky burgundy patterned shirt with flyaway lapels over disco-snug grey polyester pants.

In the first season, Song will time vault into a jewel heist getaway driver in 1985,\u00a0a space shuttle astronaut in the 1980s and into\u00a0a\u00a0woman's body (in next month's fourth episode).\u00a0 The Ziggy supercomputer that ran the Quantum Leap Project returns,\u00a0with upgrades\u00a0to expand the time-traveling scope beyond Beckett's\u00a0lifetime.\u00a0\n\"Talk about knocking off the\u00a0bucket list for an actor. And there is no limit, we're talking the possibility of prehistoric times,\" says Lee, who dons\u00a0a wildly different ensemble for each episode. \"Each week is like a whole new movie.\"\nBakula weighed in on the \"Quantum Leap\" return,\u00a0posting an OG picture Instagram\u00a0Thursday from a 1989 episode, with Beckett as a boxer, to \"quiet rumors\" and reiterate that he has \"no connection with the new show.\"\n\"So many of you have been asking me in recent months, 'How could you do QL without Sam? (or Al, for that matter.)\u00a0Well,I guess we're about to find out.\" Bakula wrote, wishing\u00a0the new show \"good luck and happy leaping.\"\nAs Bakula noted, there are noticeable deviations from the original series, including the Korean-American Lee, 35, in the time\u00a0leaper\u00a0spot for his first leading series role, (after appearing in AMC's \"Kevin Can F**k Himself\"\u00a0and \"Top Gun: Maverick\").\nThe famed \"Sam and Al\" bromance of the original has also been replaced, by a romance between Song and\u00a0Addison Augustine (Caitlin Bassett), his\u00a0fianc\u00e9e and Quantum Leap Project colleague.\u00a0\n\"We didn't want to do\u00a0another 'Sam and Al' show. That would be crazy since the last one was so perfect,\"\u00a0says Martin Gero, who is executive producing the series along with creator\u00a0Donald Bellisario and Deborah Pratt. \"This is about evolution.\u00a0We're continuing in the same world, but we're telling our own story that will absolutely brush up against the previous show.\"\nThe romance is complicated. Song heads into the time-traveling machine early for mysterious reasons, slipping away during\u00a0the couple's engagement party. Addison is able to follow in hologram form, but Song has no memory of his past, or his\u00a0fianc\u00e9e.\u00a0\n\"This relationship brings a whole new dimension,\" says Lee. \"And one side doesn\u2019t even remember it. It\u2019s like '50 First Dates' every time they meet.\"\nThe updated version will bring viewers into headquarters with the Ziggy computer for the first time, meeting the team led by Herbert \"Magic\"\u00a0Williams (Ernie Hudson), who once time-leaped with Beckett.\nWhile\u00a0Stockwell died at age 85\u00a0in 2021, the series would appear to set\u00a0stage for a Bakula re-appearance, despite the stars' distancing from the new series. Beckett never returned to the present in the original series finale, and is\u00a0presumably floating out there in time. Beckett even appears briefly in hologram form in the new series' first episode.\u00a0\nGero says that an appearance is up to Bakula. \"He gets to control that, not us. It's just a question of\u00a0when and if he wants to engage. The show\u00a0is very special to him for a lot of reasons.\"\nUntil then, it will be Lee's\u00a0Song leaping,\u00a0correcting small and large moments of history. The travel has perils well beyond the obvious,\u00a0as Lee discovers while\u00a0shooting a scene jumping from the '72 Chevrolet Malibu.\nSlamming the car door, Lee looks shocked when the ample sleeve of his polyester twill jacket\u00a0is pulled along with the bulky\u00a0closing door.\n\"I got my sleeve caught on the lock-knob thing, It's one of those things you can't prepare for. It was like, 'What is going on?' \" says Lee, laughing.\u00a0\"With this show, you really have to be on your toes.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/entertainment/tv/2022/09/19/quantum-leap-time-traveler-who-replaces-scott-bakula-raymond-lee/10402121002/", "title": "Raymond Lee hurtles through time as new 'Quantum Leap' traveler; Scott Bakula wishes 'good luck'"}, {"authors": "Maria Puente", "date_publish": "Published: 6:00 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022 Updated: 11:03 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "After 10 days of pageantry and services, Queen Elizabeth II was buried in a quiet and intimate service\u00a0away from\u00a0cameras in Windsor Castle, where she was reunited with her husband Prince Philip\u00a0and her parents.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nAfter 10 days of pageantry and services, Queen Elizabeth II was buried in a quiet and intimate service\u00a0away from\u00a0cameras in Windsor Castle, where she was reunited with her husband Prince Philip\u00a0and her parents.\nKing Charles III and senior royal family members gathered Monday for the private interment ceremony\u00a0at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George\u2019s Chapel.\u00a0Now Charles and his family will begin seven more days of mourning for the queen in what is expected to be out of the public eye.\u00a0But after that, what kind of king\u00a0will emerge?\u00a0\nIt's\u00a0taken more than\u00a070\u00a0years \u2013 the longest wait to reign in British history \u2013 for Charles to become king.\u00a0At age 73, he is the oldest monarch to ever take the British throne after his mother died at 96 on Sept. 8.\nHe has become king\u00a0in a less-than-certain\u00a0time for the crown. Some\u00a0former British colonies are looking to separate themselves from the crown and\u00a0feel Britain hasn\u2019t confronted the legacy of racism. Some\u00a0younger Britons question the need for a monarchy at all, and\u00a0Brexit has diminished some of Britain's stature and left countries questioning their need to stay connected.\nThe world reacts:\u00a0King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\nCharles will be crowned probably within a year. The ancient ritual of the coronation\u00a0requires advance planning,\u00a0although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned.\u00a0\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out decades in advance, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation\u00a0traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication,\u00a0traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a killer pandemic.\u00a0\nCharles was 4 when his mother had her coronation, a year after she became queen.\u00a0Photos show a young\u00a0bored little boy resting his face on his hand. What was most important was that he was there. Photos of Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their great grandmother's funeral felt similar \u2013 a reminder of the long line of the monarchy and its strength.\nWe can make some guesses based on what he's said and done at least since his investiture as Prince of Wales in an elaborate (and largely modern-invention ceremony) in July 1969 at\u00a0Caernarfon Castle in Wales, when he was 20.\nLegally, he became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and a host of other royal titles and duties.\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\nAnd we have a few hints from the past 10 days of mourning. Charles is much more likely than his often stone-faced mother to show emotion.\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar\u00a0at St. George\u2019s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother\u2019s coffin was lowered into the vault\nWhat happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has died?From funeral plans to processions\nJust as the queen was the longest-serving monarch in British history, Charles has been the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history \u2013\u00a0but not just that,\u00a0says his American biographer Sally Bedell Smith.\n\"His record as Prince of Wales, in its breadth and depth, will be his real legacy,\" Bedell Smith says.\u00a0\"He was the most innovative prince of Wales ever \u2013\u00a0he was an activist in a way no other heir to the throne ever has been.\"\nPart of the impetus for doing all he did, including his philanthropy, his entrepreneurial initiatives, the institutions and traditions he helped to preserve,\u00a0demonstrate \"his wish to prove himself worthy of being king,\" Bedell Smith says.\u00a0\n\"As prince of Wales, he had the freedom to do all these things, and he sometimes crossed the line of constitutional\u00a0propriety, but as prince of Wales he was not bounded by it as the queen was.\"\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96:King Charles III takes the throne\nA few days after the queen died, attitudes toward the king already improved, according YouGov/Times survey, from when they last surveyed in May.\nAsked how they anticipate his reign, 63% said they think Charles will do a good job as king, up from 32% just four months prior.\u00a0\nCharles faces a challenge few other succeeding monarchs in British history have ever faced, says Carolyn Harris, a historian and teacher at the University of Toronto and author of \"Raising Royalty: 1000 Years of Royal Parenting.\"\u00a0\n\"When there is a long reign, the monarchy and the person as the monarch come to be seen as the same,\" Harris says. \"For many people, the queen is the only monarch they've ever known, so they closely associate the monarchy with her. The challenge is to step into that\u00a0role when there's been a successful monarch in that role for decades.\"\nWhat happens to the other royals?King Charles III promises a new slimmed-down monarchy\nCharles has made no secret of his desire to \"slim down\" the monarchy\u00a0\u2013 reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers\u00a0\u2013 and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show.\u00a0\nHis many causes (organic farming, architecture and urban planning, fighting climate change, to name a few) will not be abandoned but at least initially\u00a0he will be too busy with routine matters, such as weekly meetings with the prime minister and going through the multiple red boxes of government documents he must read daily, Bedell Smith predicts.\u00a0\nA tiny detail about the wreath that lay on the queen's coffin demonstrates the king's commitment to the earth. At the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath was\u00a0made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\nKing Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth:What to know about British royal line\nCharles' interest in religions expands beyond the Church of England.\u00a0\nTraditionally known as the \"Defender of the Faith,\" Charles called himself a \"committed Anglican Christian\" in a meeting with faith leaders Friday at Buckingham Palace. But he also embraced the faith diversity of modern Britain and promised to protect it.\u00a0\n\"By\u00a0my most profound convictions, therefore \u2013 as well as by my\u00a0position as sovereign \u2013 I hold myself bound to respect those\u00a0who follow other spiritual paths, as well as those who seek to\u00a0live their lives in accordance with secular ideals,\" he said.\u00a0\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\nMost of the speculation about the new king has focused on whether Charles would violate those prohibitions by being outspoken about political and other matters of public debate in a way his mother carefully avoided.\u00a0\nAs prince of Wales, Charles was not always as scrupulous as his mother was, says Clive Irving,\u00a0a longtime British journalist (former managing editor of the Sunday Times in London) and author of\u00a0\"The Last Queen,\" a biography of Charles' mother that questions whether the monarchy can survive after her.\n\"She has always been neutral and apolitical, no one has caught her out on her political views and that is the difference between her and Charles\u00a0\u2013 he can't help himself,\" says Irving.\u00a0\nA frank critic of Charles, Irving describes him as a\u00a0\"self-centered and narcissistic,\" having lived a coddled,\u00a0entitled and privileged existence, an \"archaic-looking figure\" out of step with the times, and unused to being challenged.\u00a0\n\"How can that kind of psychology possibly adapt to a completely different\u00a0responsibility as head of state?\" Irving says. \"The magic of monarchy means something different to him, he interprets it through his own psychology.\"\nIrving predicts that the first year of Charles' reign will see the monarchy head \"over a cliff very fast\" amid disillusionment with the new king.\u00a0\"How\u00a0can he possibly\u00a0share the realities of our lives if he's never lived those realities?\"\u00a0\nHowever privileged his upbringing, Charles has gone out of his way to demonstrate he cares about the less fortunate, especially through his charities, such as the Prince's Trust, which he founded in 1976 to help disadvantaged youths. The trust claims to have provided support to more than 1 million youths over the years.\nThe queen's popularity didn't translate into the monarchy itself. Fifty-eight percent of Canadians polled by Ipsos\u00a0just a few days after the queen\u2019s death said the time has come for Canada to hold a referendum on ending its formal ties to the British throne.\nIt\u2019s not just the Canadians who are rethinking their connection to the crown.\u00a0The queen\u2019s death also raises questions about the future of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 countries that include the 14 in which the British\u00a0monarch remains their head of state.\u00a0Calls for them to break away and form a republic are likely to spread now that the queen\u2019s reign has ended, analysts said.\n\u201cHer absence, combined with recent developments in British politics, gives these countries certainly an opening, even perhaps an impetus, to start thinking about breaking away,\u201d said Mark Vail, an expert on British politics and history at Wake Forest University.\nThe Commonwealth won't collapse tomorrow,\u00a0said Sue Onslow, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London, but\u00a0\u201cthe processes of change are accelerating.\u201d\nStill, leaders of several of those independent countries chafed\u00a0at being under the monarch\u2019s eye even though, personally, the queen was viewed favorably.\nLast November, Barbados officially ended nearly 400 years of British rule when it removed Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and swore in its own president in a ceremony in which Prince Charles \u2013 now King Charles III \u2013 was the guest of honor.\nThe queen\u2019s grandson, Prince William, and his wife,\u00a0Princess Kate, were met with protests and calls for slavery reparations last spring when they embarked upon a tour of Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas. Jamaica\u2019s prime minister, Andrew Holness, informed the couple that his country would be moving ahead with its plans to ditch the monarchy and become a republic. Belize also signaled its intentions to break from the crown.\nJust days after the queen\u2019s death, Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, told Britain\u2019s ITV News that within three years he plans to hold a referendum on his country ditching the crown and becoming a republic.\nKing Charles, however, doesn\u2019t engender the same reverence as his mother. \u201cThose are hard shoes to fill for Charles,\u201d Vail said.\n\"I think the noises that have been made by certain countries (to break from the crown) are just the beginning,\u201d Vail said.\nContributing: Michael Collins and\u00a0Kim Hjelmgaard", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/20/king-charles-what-happens-now-the-queen-funeral-is-over/10430194002/", "title": "Now that the funeral is over, what's next for King Charles and how will he reign?"}, {"authors": " Barbara VanDenburgh", "date_publish": "Published: 6:00 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022 Updated: 12:04 p.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "\"Gender Queer\"\u00a0doesn't take long to read, an hour or two tops.

It's also the most banned book in the country, according to the American Library Association, which last year logged the highest number of book banning attempts since it began recording data in 2000.\n\"Gender Queer\" is in\u00a0the eye of a political storm,\u00a0a largely conservative push to remove certain titles from schools and libraries, especially those that center\u00a0racism,\u00a0sexuality and gender identity.\nBanned books explained:What are the most banned books and why?\nMore:\u00a0These 51 books are targets for book bans. Here's why you should read them now\nAnd censors aren't stopping at school boards. Just a few weeks ago, a Virginia judge tossed out a lawsuit that sought to deem \u201cGender Queer\u201d obscene and restrict its distribution, even at retailers.\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously very grateful that the case was dismissed and that the judge made a very firm ruling,\u201d Kobabe says. \u201cShe actually ruled it unconstitutional.\u201d\nKobabe, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns e/em/eir, spoke about book banning and what makes \"Gender Queer\" such a magnet for censorship:\nQuestion: What do you think makes \u201cGender Queer\u201d such a target for book banning?\nAnswer: I think the fact that it is a graphic novel is a big part of it. The fact that it\u2019s an illustrated book makes it more vulnerable to book challenges. It\u2019s very easy for someone to quickly flip through the book and find two or three pages they might disagree with without having to sit down and read the whole thing.\nI do think another factor is that it won a couple of awards from the American Library Association in 2020. It won an Alex Award and also a Stonewall Book Award, and many librarians purchase ALA award winners. It was just sort of well-placed in many public libraries and school libraries because the librarians had supported it.\nAuthors of most banned books in the U.S. speak up: 'We can\u2019t take these freedoms for granted'\nWhy is it important for students to have free access to \u201cGender Queer\u201d?\nYoung people don\u2019t have a ton of discretionary income. It\u2019s so important that they can access media, especially books, for free. A lot of queer, trans and nonbinary kids don\u2019t necessarily have an adult role model in their family or even in their school to turn to. One of the best ways they can look up information on their identity, or find answers to questions they might be having or find role models and\u00a0adults they can look up to, is through media and through books.\nWhat would it have meant to you as a teen to have had a book like \"Gender Queer\"?\nIt would have been huge. I was searching everywhere for every tiny scrap of queer narrative I could find. At the most, I usually found stories where a trans or nonbinary character was a very small side character. I don\u2019t remember any books where the trans or nonbinary character was the lead and it was really about their story and about their journey. I think if I\u2019d had a book like this, it could have taken 10 years off of my questioning and confusion and uncertainty about who I was and how I was going to fit into the world.\nHow does it make you feel to have your book targeted? Does it feel personal?\nI absolutely see it as part of a widescale political attack. I actually don\u2019t take almost any of it personally, certainly because of how often people who complain about my book openly state that they have not read it. I see it as part of the organized effort to erase trans, queer and nonbinary voices from the public sphere. I see it as part of the movement of different states limiting access to trans healthcare and trans students\u2019 rights to be involved in activities, from sports to clubs to journalism. I see it along the lines of the Don\u2019t Say Gay bill in Florida. It all feels like many parts of this really damaging and upsetting and worrying effort to make it harder and harder for trans and nonbinary people to exist in public.\nPreserving the freedom to read:After 40 years of Banned Book Week, librarians craft new plan to fight back\nHas the backlash changed your approach to writing, or has it conversely made you more confident?\nI think it\u2019s probably made me more confident because I think the fact that what I\u2019ve written has received such a strong response means that I was saying something that people react to, that people have feelings about. I\u2019m trying to not let it impact too much of what I want to write in the future. I think it strengthens my determination to keep telling very queer, very nonbinary stories in the future, because clearly we need more of them.\nDo you hear from young trans and nonbinary readers who\u2019ve read your book?\nAll the time.\u00a0I have received probably 10-to-1 more positive responses than negative ones. I\u2019ve had so many readers reach out to say that the book really touched them, that it meant a lot, that it was the first time they felt like they were seen in a narrative, that their own experiences and memories were reflected in a narrative. I\u2019ve had people tell me, \u2018It\u2019s like you looked in my brain and wrote my life. How did you do that?\u2019 I\u2019ve had people tell me the book felt like a hug or that it made them feel less alone. I\u2019ve had people tell me they gave the book to their parents, and their parents use their pronouns better now.\nDid the book help your family understand you better?\nI do think the book helped build my own personal relationships. In a huge regard, I wrote the book as an extended letter to my own parents and my family members, my aunts and uncles, because I was trying to come out and I was trying to explain nonbinary pronouns. When I switched to using the pronouns e/em/eir, some of my family was really struggling with that.\u00a0\nMy parents both read drafts of the book while I was working on it, and it really opened up a lot of conversations, and a few other people in my family have come out since reading the book. It\u2019s been a really positive thing in my life.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/entertainment/books/2022/09/20/banned-books-gender-queer-maia-kobabe-censorship/8019962001/", "title": "'Gender Queer' author Maia Kobabe talks banned books: 'Part of a widescale political attack'"}, {"authors": " Edward Segarra", "date_publish": "Published: 9:48 p.m. ET Sept. 19, 2022 Updated: 9:18 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "Eugenio Derbez is speaking out about the painful accident that landed him in the hospital last month.", "category": "", "language": "en", "source_domain": "usatoday.com", "maintext": "\nEugenio Derbez is speaking out about the painful accident that landed him in the hospital last month.\nIn an Instagram Live video posted Sunday, the \u201cAcapulco\u201d star thanked his fans for all the \"expressions of affection\u201d he\u2019s received online since the accident, sharing that he\u2019s hardly touched his phone because he\u2019s spent much of his early recovery in a sedated state.\n\u201cI know that what you all want to know the most is what happened, how it happened, and I would like to know why it happened,\u201d said Derbez of the accident, in Spanish. \u201cPeople have always told me that things happen for a reason.\u201d\nDerbez said the accident took place while playing a virtual reality game with his son.

Accusations of pedophilia.\nWe\u2019re not talking about a prison yard\u00a0but schools and public libraries, which have become battlegrounds in an escalating culture war that puts books centering on racism, sexuality and gender identity at risk, as well as the people writing and defending them.\nOver the past year, there has\u00a0been a dramatic increase in attempted book bans \u2013\u00a0more than ever recorded by\u00a0The American Library Association\u00a0(ALA), which tracks censorship attempts and annually publishes a list of the most targeted titles. The effort to remove books from schools and libraries often results in headlines about the\u00a0coordinated harassment of teachers, librarians and authors.\nWe spoke to eight of the authors of the 10 most frequently banned books\u00a0to get their perspective on book banning and how it has\u00a0affected their lives and careers. (Angie Thomas, author of the fifth most-banned book, \u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d declined to be interviewed. Toni Morrison, author of the eighth most-banned book, \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d died in 2019, and when she was alive did not wish to speak publicly about the banning of her books, according to her editors.)\nThe majority of authors we spoke to believe their books have been willfully misrepresented as part of a political movement seeking to silence marginalized voices.\nHere\u2019s what each person had to say:\nBook bans are on the rise:What are the most banned books and why?\nThe most banned book of 2021 was Kobabe\u2019s 2019 graphic memoir \u201cGender Queer\u201d \u2013 and this year isn\u2019t going any easier on the book. In late August, a Virginia judge tossed out a lawsuit that sought to deem \u201cGender Queer\u201d obscene and restrict its distribution,\u00a0including by booksellers and libraries.\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously very grateful that the case was dismissed and that the judge made a very firm ruling,\u201d Kobabe says. \u201cShe actually ruled it unconstitutional.\u201d\nThe autobiographical book tells the story of Kobabe\u2019s young adulthood and eventual coming out as nonbinary after many years of gender confusion. Kobabe, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns e/em/eir, says a book like \u201cGender Queer\u201d would have been a lifesaver in adolescence.\n\u201cI think if I\u2019d had a book like this, it could have taken 10 years off of my questioning and confusion and uncertainty about who I was and how I was going to fit into the world,\u201d\u00a0Kobabe says.\nIt\u2019s important books remain freely accessible to readers in classrooms and libraries because \u201cyoung people don\u2019t have a ton of discretionary income,\u201d Kobabe says. That goes especially for queer kids who \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily have an adult role model in their family or even in their school to turn to.\"\u00a0One of the best ways they can look up information on their identity, or find answers to questions they might be having, is through media and through books.\u201d\n'Gender Queer':Judge tosses suit that tried to deem book obscene\nKobabe sees book banning as part of a \u201cwidescale political attack\u201d that goes hand-in-hand with\u00a0legislation like Florida\u2019s Parental Rights in Education bill, derided by opponents as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. \u201cI see it as part of the organized effort to erase trans, queer and nonbinary voices from the public sphere,\u201d Kobabe says.\nThe backlash hasn\u2019t affected Kobabe\u2019s plans for future books. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably made me more confident,\"Kobabe says. \u201cIt strengthens my determination to keep telling very queer, very nonbinary stories in the future, because clearly we need more of them.\u201d\nThe backlash against the 2018 novel \u201cLawn Boy\u201d began with a Leander, Texas, school board meeting in September 2021. Evison \u2013 who has\u00a0written several books since, including this year\u2019s \u201cSmall World\u201d\u00a0\u2013 found out when he woke up and checked his email and social media messages.\n\u201cI started opening these messages, and the first one was a death threat. The next one was calling me a pedophile and a groomer. And the next one was describing horrible things sexually about my daughters,\u201d Evison says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, 'What in the hell is going on?'\u201d\nSoon after, then gubernatorial candidate (and now governor of Virginia) Glenn Youngkin \u201cweaponized the book banning issue,\u201d Evison says, \u201cspinning the issue as, \u2018These woke teachers are trying to indoctrinate your kids and keep your voice out of the classroom.\u2019 Since then, it\u2019s just all been naked political posturing.\u201d\n\u201cLawn Boy\" tells the story of Mike Mu\u00f1oz, a young Mexican American man who has\u00a0met with hardship at every turn and goes on a journey of self-discovery at the library. The book confronts difficult questions including racism and class stereotypes and was the second-most banned book last year.\u00a0\n\u201cI can kind of see what scares these people about the book,\u201d Evison says. \u201cBecause it speaks to marginalized people who they\u2019d rather just keep marginalized.\u201d\nAnd like the character in his book searching the library for stories that speak to his working-class experience, Evison says, kids have a right to free access to books in which they can see their own experiences reflected.\n\u201cThis is a question a whole generation of young readers is going to be asking themselves if these people have their way: \u2018Where are the books about me?\u2019\u201d Evison says.\nEvison says book banning is a political straw man, and the stakes are much higher than just the books being targeted. \u201cIn this political climate and this divisive, tribal world we live in now, we can\u2019t take these freedoms for granted,\u201d he says.\nJohnson\u2019s 2020 \u201cmemoir-manifesto\u201d is No. 3 on the ALA\u2019s list of most-banned books and is often targeted for its queer and sexual content.\n\u201cI guess I did take it as a source of pride, as a storyteller, especially a Black, queer storyteller,\"\u00a0Johnson says of the bans. \"You make any list with Toni Morrison, you must be doing something right.\u201d\nJohnson, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, shares stories from their life in the autobiographical book, including difficult ones involving\u00a0sexual assault and racism. Johnson says\u00a0it\u2019s important to be honest with young readers.\n\u201cSometimes we feel a certain way but we can\u2019t express how we feel until we read somebody else going through a similar thing, and then it allows us to say, \u2018This is exactly how I felt,\u2019\u201d Johnson says. \u201cOne of the ways we as a society gain empathy is through learning other people\u2019s stories from their own eyes.\u201d\nJohnson says they first learned their book was targeted at a school board in Kansas City, Missouri, in September 2021. \u201cBy November, it had reached 10 states and a criminal complaint was filed,\u201d Johnson says. Then the bans really started to take off.\n\u201cI think every two to three years, conservatives just pick a new thing to be their lynchpin, hot-button issue, and I think this is that,\"\u00a0Johnson says. \"I truly feel like once they get through the midterm elections, depending on how they turn out, we will probably see them not even care about the book bans anymore.\u201d\nJohnson\u00a0says the bans have bolstered their resolve to write queer stories. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed is just that I want to write more stories for that demographic,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re just going to have to ban all of my books then, because I\u2019m going to keep writing them.\u201d\nP\u00e9rez\u2019s 2015\u00a0historical young adult novel had been out for nearly six years before the author learned of the first ban.\n\u201cNow my book\u2019s been banned dozens of times, and it\u2019s devastating each time,\u201d P\u00e9rez says. \u201cI\u2019m a former high school teacher, and I think about the kids who are losing access to stories that they need.\u201d\n\u201cOut of Darkness\u201d tells the story of a teenage love affair between a Mexican American girl and African American boy in 1930s Texas, against the backdrop of the New London School explosion, a natural gas disaster that killed nearly 300 people. The book is notable in part for its historical depiction of Latino and Black experiences with racism.\n'Once I Was You':Maria Hinojosa wants young Latinos to 'feel empowered'\n\u201cThe book didn\u2019t change, the political climate did,\u201d P\u00e9rez says. \u201cMany of the people bringing challenges don\u2019t even have school-age children. For the most part, it\u2019s not actually parents concerned about their kids, it\u2019s people who\u2019ve been swept up into a political game.\u201d\nP\u00e9rez, now a professor at Ohio State University, takes no pride in the book banning. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be proud or excited about with young people not being able to find the books that they need in their school library,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be excited about teachers and librarians being harassed and called pedophiles and groomers for simply serving young people.\u201d\nP\u00e9rez herself has also been harassed, as have her co-workers, who\u2019ve received obscene messages. Despite the harassment, P\u00e9rez is unwavering in her belief that students should have free access to her book, which she says helps readers face difficult historical realities, including racial violence.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t look at our histories, if we aren\u2019t brave enough to recognize what have been lived realities in the past, we really are going to struggle to support ourselves and others in changing our communities and advancing, creating space for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen school leaders cave to these attacks, it really does send a message of exclusion to the kids who have the identities that are being targeted.\u201d\nAlexie is a long-timer on banned-books lists. The Spokane-Coeur d'Alene Native American novelist\u2019s 2007 young adult book \u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\u201d is told from the perspective of adolescent protagonist Arnold Spirit Jr., who lives on the Spokane Indian Reservation while attending an all-white high school.\n\u201cIt's the story of the kid trying to find the place where he belongs. It's a journey for self-identity,\u201d Alexie says.\nThe book grapples with difficult issues including poverty, alcoholism, cultural barriers and identity. These are qualities that won the book the National Book Award for Young People's Literature and the American Library Association's Best Books for Young Adults \u2013 and made it a magnet for censorship.\nBans started \"the first semester after it was released,\u201d Alexie says. The book has been a perennial presence on the ALA\u2019s annual list of the top 10 most-banned books. It now\u00a0sits at No. 6 and is often targeted for profanity and sexual references.\n\u201cI'm writing realism. In high school, boys talk like that. Men talk like that,\u201d Alexie says. \u201cYou would think the book was graphic. And it's not really.\"\nLike many authors targeted, Alexie sees the attacks on his book as part of a larger political movement. \u201cWhether it's done by the left or right, it's the first stage toward authoritarian governments,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's not a small thing. It's the way in which Mao and Stalin started, to get rid of the intellectual, to disappear the intellectuals.\u201d\nBut the book bans haven\u2019t dissuaded Alexie. \u201cIt has it has reassured me that I'm doing the right thing,\u201d he says. He also believes children can see through it. \u201cI would say that the parents who want to ban books are not being honest with their children. Yeah, and that their children know it.\u201d\nThe seventh most-banned book of 2021 is an outlier.\nAndrews\u2019 2012 young adult novel \u201cMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\u201d follows high schooler Greg Gaines, a loner who spends most of his time with his sole friend, Earl, and a girl dying of leukemia.\nThe book is frequently challenged for what Andrews calls \u201cgarden-variety profanity\u201d that captures the way teenage boys talk.\n\u201cI thought that kind of naturalism would makes it look appealing to other teenagers and make it feel real to them,\u201d Andrews says. \u201cI hear from a lot of readers who are like:\u00a0\u2018You know, a lot of books, just don't feel natural to me. I don't love reading, but I like reading your book.\u2019\u201d\nAndrews says cherry-picked passages misrepresent the book and its intentions. \u201cIt's about teenage boys talking about sex. They're not having it, they barely know what it is. They're joking about it, the way teenagers often do,\u201d Andrews says. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of an innocent naivete to it that gets totally lost when you're selecting a couple of sentences and reading it out loud in this aggrieved tone to the school board.\u201d\nAndrews says his book stands out in contrast to most of the books on the ALA list, which are by and about people of color and LGBTQ people.\n\u201cI'm a lot more concerned about the censorship of those books than I am about my own,\u201d Andrews says. \u201cMost of the other books on the list are about the trans experience, the Black experience, queer experience. And that is, I think, much more what a certain political movement in this country is trying to silence.\u201d\n\u201cThis Book Is Gay\u201d\u00a0wears its intentions proudly on its rainbow-colored cover.\nWritten in 2014 by Dawson, a transgender activist and author, \u201cThis Book Is Gay\u201d is an LGBTQ instruction manual with how-to chapter titles like \u201cComing Out,\u201d \u201cWhere to Meet People Like You\u201d and \u201cThe Ins and Outs of Gay Sex.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the sort of book Dawson wishes she\u2019d had as a young queer person, which is why it stings that it\u00a0has been made less accessible. It ranks at No. 9 on the ALA\u2019s list of most-banned books of 2021.\n\u201cWhen I wrote it, it was everything I wish I'd known when I was 15 years old,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cI didn't know I was trans until I was well into my 20s. I didn't have any information and my parents didn't have any information.\u201d\nLet's talk about (queer) sex:The importance of LGBTQ-inclusive sex education in schools\nThe first time Dawson remembers the book being challenged was in 2015 at a public library in Wasilla, Alaska. That particular detail was amusing to Dawson, who\u2019s British.\n\u201cIt was funny the first time it happened it was in Sarah Palin's old stomping ground,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cI can't speak for her reputation in the U.S., but over here she was kind of a laughingstock.\u201d\nBut the amusement quickly wore off. \u201cMaybe for like a minute, I was kind of like, 'Oh, that's really rock 'n' roll. But then I was just sad, you know? And it's that sadness that's remained,\u201d Dawson says. \u201cIt's still, after all these years, telling LGBTQ teenagers that there's something wrong with them, that they are something taboo, that they are something that should be challenged. And I really think that's what this boils down to:\u00a0You can't ban a transgender teenager, but you can ban a book about transgender teenagers.\u201d\n\u201cBeyond Magenta\u201d was warmly received when it was released in 2014.\n\u201cThe first year I was amazed at the reviews that were so, so positive and welcoming,\u00a0saying how much this book was needed,\u201d Kuklin says. A writer and photographer, Kuklin interviewed and photographed six transgender young adults for the book, augmenting their first-person narratives with portraits, family photographs and candid images.\nWhen the ALA looked at the most-banned books from 2010 to 2019,\u00a0\u201cBeyond Magenta\u201d came in at No. 27. It was the 10th most frequently banned book of 2021.\n\u201cI was somewhat concerned about the language because there are a lot of F-bombs in the book, but that's how kids speak,\u201d Kuklin says. She doesn\u2019t think profanity is the real reason for banning. \u201cIt was really about being trans, which I find unbelievably horrible and wrong.\u201d\nThat the book offers so many insights into transgender experiences is owed to the vulnerability of Kuklin\u2019s subjects, who opened up to the author about the challenges they face. That makes the backlash especially sting.\n\u201cI was angry because here were really terrific kids who were willing to speak so candidly and so honestly about who they are and what they are, and I felt that I needed to protect them,\u201d Kuklin says. \u201cWe have so much more in common than we have differences. And just to learn about who other people are might make it easier to understand them better.\u201d\nMore impactful than criticism for Kuklin was the positive feedback she received \u2013 specifically, six emails from trans readers who felt seen.\n\u201cI received six emails that I will cherish for the rest of my life because they were from young people who were contemplating suicide because they were trans. They didn't know what to do,\u201d Kuklin says. \u201cI tear up every time I think about it. If they were the only six people who ever read the book, that would have been fine.\u201d\nContributing:\u00a0Angie Orellana Hernandez, USA TODAY\nFrom Bette Midler to J.K.

The queen's eldest son,\u00a0Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is\u00a0now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\u00a0But the date for the\u00a0formal coronation ceremony for\u00a0the new king has not yet been announced.\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new\u00a0photo of Queen Elizabeth II\u00a0climbing a hill with a\u00a0walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance,\u00a0wearing\u00a0sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony\u00a0away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband\u00a0and her parents.\nCharles\u00a0and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George\u2019s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\nIn contrast to\u00a0the pomp and pageantry of her\u00a0grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's\u00a0internment\u00a0was a \u201cdeeply personal family occasion.\u201d They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip\u2019s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George\u2019s.\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George\u2019s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\nElizabeth II\u2019s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch\u2019s younger sister who died in 2002.\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I. It is also the home of the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of chivalry founded by King Edward III in 1348.\nWestminster Abbey: See Queen Elizabeth at the iconic church where she was married, crowned, laid to rest\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation\u00a0requires advance planning,\u00a0although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953\u00a0when Elizabeth was crowned,\u00a0following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event.\u00a0But\u00a0there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\u00a0\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out for decades, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation\u00a0traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication,\u00a0traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a pandemic.\u00a0\nThe state funeral, expected to be the\u00a0biggest gathering of world leaders in years, drew \u00a0millions of people to the streets of London\u00a0and likely billions more to their TVs and computer screens. The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\u00a0\nLondon\u2019s mayor\u2019s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey.\u00a0More than 10,000 police officers were on patrol in London with reinforcements supplied from all of Britain\u2019s 43 police forces, authorities said.\nThe royal family:A look at the British royal family tree, spanning four generations\nRead more about what to expect from the reign of King Charles III:\u00a0What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\nSome celebrities posted on social media to pay their respects to the late queen, while others attended Monday\u2019s events to do the same.\nDavid Beckham, who waited in the queue like thousands of others to visit the queen\u2019s coffin as it laid in state last week, posted a photo on Instagram.\n\u201cOur Queen is home.. Today we said a final farewell to Her Majesty The Queen,\u201d he wrote in the caption.\nSandra Oh attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey, posting\u00a0\u00a0several photos on Instagram, featuring the actress wearing mourning colors.\nAnd Elton John posted photos, too, remembering some moments he shared with the queen and noting she will be \"sorely missed.\"\n\u201cMy own memories of her are filled with joy and admiration,\" he wrote.\u00a0The Queen honoured me with a CBE, a knighthood and the Companion of Honour. I was lucky enough to perform at three of her Jubilees. They were always joyous and humbling experiences. But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\u00a0\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\u00a0\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen\u2019s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar\u00a0at St. George\u2019s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\nThe\u00a0\u201cWand of Office\u201d was broken\u00a0by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign\u2019s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn\u2019t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother\u2019s coffin was lowered into the vault.\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral? How she manages to stay stoic\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary attended the queen's state funeral. They were also among early arrivals\u00a0to St George's chapel for the committal service.\nAt the state funeral, Truss read a prayer from\u00a0Bible\u2019s John 14: 1-9.\nMother and daughter duo Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte, who attended the state funeral, both wore simple black dresses topped with black overcoats, paired with black tights and black shoes. But their jewelry choices paid tribute to a beloved matriarch.\nPrincess Charlotte\u00a0wore a dainty brooch on her coat in the shape of a horseshoe, a tribute to the queen, her great-grandmother, who had a lifelong passion for horses. The queen often attended\u00a0races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law. She wore\u00a0Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings\u00a0and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection,\u00a0People reported.\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin \u2013 accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family \u2013 was carried through the capital\u2019s streets.\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle \u2013 where Elizabeth spent much of her time \u2013 for another procession before a committal service in St\u00a0George\u2019s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\nThe queen\u2019s coffin was\u00a0moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was\u00a0taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and\u00a0St\u00a0George's Chapel,\u00a0a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where\u00a0Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married\u00a0in 2018.\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St\u00a0George\u2019s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen\u2019s coffin to be viewed \u2013 and it is lit up when it is dark out.\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto\u00a0the gun carriage.\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St\u00a0George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\nThe program also included:\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal \u2013 it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch\u2019s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth\u2019s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana\u2019s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\nAccording to Buckingham Palace\u2019s notes on the funeral, the queen\u2019s wreath included, at the king\u2019s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king\u2019s private home Highgrove House.\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen\u2019s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\nThe top British royals:\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen\u2019s family, including descendants of her mother\u2019s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\"\u00a0of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan\u2019s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany\u2019s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland\u2019s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\u00a0\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military\u00a0medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\u00a0\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during\u00a0the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\u00a0\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson\u00a0wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\nThe queen's casket\u00a0entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\u00a0\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\u00a0\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\nThe choir of St\u00a0George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with\u00a0the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\"\u00a0The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord\u2019s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household\u00a0said\u00a0it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons. \u00a0\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told\u00a0British outlet\u00a0the Times\u00a0\"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\u201cOak coffins are now made from American oak. I don\u2019t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,\u201d he told the outlet. \u00a0\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons\u00a0said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen\u2019s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone \u2013 the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa \u2013 rests at the top of the monarch\u2019s scepter. \u00a0\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region\u2019s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen\u2019s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\u00a0\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\u00a0\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\u00a0\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales,\u00a0with her children,\u00a0Prince George\u00a0and\u00a0Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\nMore members of the royal family, including\u00a0Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\u00a0\nThe funeral\u2019s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\nThe royal children\u2019s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\u00a0\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders\u00a0who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen\u2019s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and\u00a0wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President\u00a0Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth\u2019s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It\u2019s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you\u2019ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including\u00a0Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton,\u00a0were\u00a0also photographed upon arrival.\u00a0\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\nThe queen will be buried at St\u00a0George Chapel\u00a0at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession\u00a0will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family,\u00a0past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\nAhead of\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II's\u00a0funeral,\u00a0King Charles III\u00a0issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\u00a0\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\"As\u00a0we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\u00a0\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\u00a0\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\u00a0\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\u00a0\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III.\u00a0Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral will be held\u00a0Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and\u00a0\u201chas been the setting for every coronation since 1066\u201d and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey\u2019s website says.\n\u201cHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,\u201d the site says. \u201cAs an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.\u201d\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey\u2019s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother\u2019s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\nVisual guide\u00a0to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\nThe\u00a0queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96\u00a0after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\nNot since 1965, for\u00a0former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state\u00a0funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details.\u00a0The choice of flowers in the wreath\u00a0on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the\u00a0bespoke design of the Royal Hearse\u00a0(lots of glass and inside light so the casket\u00a0can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\u00a0\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen\u2019s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London\u2019s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and\u00a0Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral,\u00a0the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route.\u00a0The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere \u2013 lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were \u201cqueen favorites\u201d including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren\u2019t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\"We\u2019re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\"\u00a0Hartnell said.\nThey said the transition to a king likely won\u2019t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don\u2019t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it \u2026 we just like having them,\" she said.\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and\u00a0Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/19/queen-elizabeth-funeral-live-updates/10419491002/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II funeral updates: Queen laid to rest alongside husband in private ceremony"}, {"authors": " Kathleen Wong", "date_publish": "Published: 5:00 a.m. ET Sept. 17, 2022 Updated: 3:26 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2022", "description": "With year-round warm weather, stunning natural beauty, and a rich culture, Hawaii has earned its spot on the top of many people's bucket lists.

Each day, thousands of people arrive, excited to experience the island chain.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, the high levels of tourism haven't gone without a negative\u00a0impact on the islands. From overcrowded trails\u00a0to traffic congestion, the islands are now seeking a new type of visitor, who wants to create a deeper connection with Hawaii.\n\"It is important to Hawaii to uphold the values of our native culture and we have been excellent in portraying the spirit of aloha in Hawaii and across the world, but we also need to ensure that our visitors are also on the same page,\"\u00a0Malia Sanders, executive director at the Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association, told USA TODAY.\n\"The visitor of today wants to learn, they want to engage, they want to play an active role in protecting the environment and preserving the natural wonders and beauty of Hawaii\u00a0so that they can continue to enjoy it again and again,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\nIn a 2022 Booking.com survey, 66% of the 30,000 respondents said they wanted to experience the local culture of the places they visit, and more than half of the respondents said they wanted to leave the place better than when they arrived.\n\"If you plan your itinerary full of things that are educational, cultural, leave a positive impact\u00a0and make you a better visitor, you are bound to have a truly authentic experience when visiting Hawaii,\" she said.\nHere are a few ways you can learn more about the islands' history and culture on a trip to Hawaii \u2013 without breaking the bank.\nGive back to the islands with your time, and in turn, you'll meet dedicated locals and make a positive impact on the community. Many local nonprofits welcome visitors to volunteer,\u00a0and you can find\u00a0opportunities at travel2change.org.\nYour volunteer work may even result in a cheaper hotel bill. The Hawaiian Tourism Authority recently launched the Malama Hawaii Program, offering visitors special discounts at certain hotels when they participate in a dedicated volunteer activity, such as beach cleanups or reforestation.\nFailing to take the time to research\u00a0your destination beforehand can actually hinder your trip, Sanders said:\u00a0\"At most, you will only discover what you accidentally stumble on to, you may encounter misinformation that isn\u2019t authentic, and you may not have an enjoyable experience if it ends up taking you into places where you may not be safe or do not belong.\n\"As visitors, we have a responsibility to be as best prepared as possible, whether here in Hawaii or any other destination around the world. Preparing ourselves for a deeply rich cultural place requires us to do some homework as a visitor. We want to be responsible about how we act as guests.\"\u00a0\nBy this\u00a0she means learning the customs and traditions of the place you're visiting\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like how a kiss on the cheek is a common greeting in the islands\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and what activities may be harmful\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as swimming too close to wildlife,\u00a0or taking rocks or sand home from the beach.\nTake the time to learn about where you're staying, since different parts of the islands have cultural\u00a0significance. For example, Oahu's Waikiki, the heart of tourism in Hawaii, was once a historic battle site and where Hawaiian royalty like Princess Kaiulani\u00a0owned estates.\n\"Where you spend your dollar in Hawaii truly matters,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\"In the regenerative tourism model, the circular economy is a key component to its success. Buying and shopping local reduces capital flight and keeps that dollar continuously circulating into the local economy.\n\"Read the labels of the things you buy while on vacation. If it is made in Hawaii, it will usually say so or have a Hawaii address on the label.\"\u00a0\nSeek out\u00a0mom-and-pop shops or Native Hawaiian-owned businesses, which you can find online at Kuhikuhi. Purchasing a gift from somewhere like the family-owned Hot Island Glass gallery on Maui rather than a big-name store will not only directly reinvest\u00a0in this local family, but also give you something handcrafted and more connected to the islands.\u00a0\nFrom paniolos to plantations, for\u00a0many years, the agricultural sector has been a critical part of feeding Hawaii and expanding Hawaii's staple exports, like sugar and pineapple.\u00a0Choose to support and get to know the farmers and eateries that use ingredients from the islands. Plus, you'll also be tasting some of the freshest food available and flavors from the cultures that make up modern-day Hawaii, making the decision a win-win.\u00a0\nMore tourists seem to agree. A new study by researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa found that 78% of tourists from the continental U.S. are willing to pay a premium for locally grown food.\u00a0\nThere are lots of places to eat in Hawaii that won't drain your wallet, such as the many Asian food stalls in Maunakea Marketplace in Honolulu's Chinatown or a plate lunch at the family-owned Sueoka Market on Kauai.\u00a0\nAlso consider going straight to the source and booking a farm tour, which you can find on every island, like Kona Coffee Living History Farm on Hawaii Island and\u00a0O'o Farm\u00a0in Upcountry, Maui. These farm tours are often inexpensive and introduce you to the passionate folks of Hawaii's agricultural sector. You can also stop by a farmers market to check out what tropical produce\u00a0is grown in Hawaii.\nThroughout the year, Hawaii hosts many festivals and events that celebrate the cultures and traditions rooted in the islands. In November, there is the\u00a0Kona Coffee Cultural Festival, honoring the farmers, growers and roasters of the longstanding coffee community, on the Big Island. In September, there is the Okinawan Festival on Oahu, celebrating all things Okinawan (which also has a large population in Hawaii.)\nThere are also smaller, more frequent events that support local businesses and the arts and culture scene,\u00a0like the weekly\u00a0Hanapepe Art Night on Kauai and monthly First Fridays\u00a0in Honolulu. Entry to these events are often free.\u00a0\nAlthough you probably want to spend most of your time in Hawaii outside at the beach, it's important as a visitor to get a deeper understanding of Hawaii's past and present, from its Polynesian roots, to the tragic overthrow and statehood.\u00a0\nMake time to visit one of the islands' many cultural institutions, like\u00a0Honolulu's 'Iolani Palace\u00a0to Hawaii Island's Hulihe'e Palace.\u00a0If you're traveling on a budget, some museums like Bishop Museum, the largest collection of Hawaiian and Pacific cultural artifacts and natural specimens in the world,\u00a0host After Hours events with cheaper admission.\u00a0\nThese days, many\u00a0hotels in Hawaii have decided to employ cultural advisers, or people who are deeply rooted in Hawaiian culture and its values and practices. After many years of the media misrepresenting Hawaiians and their culture for entertainment and tourism, these people\u00a0work hard to ensure the hotel shares Hawaiian culture in appropriate ways and set up workshops and other activities to educate guests.

Applicants will receive an email to activate your account.\nApplicants can log in and see an option to \"Renew Passport\" after four hours past registration.\nTo complete the online renewal, applicants will also need to be able to upload a digital photo\u00a0and pay using a credit or debit card or Automated Clearing House.\u00a0\nThe pilot program is taking applications on \"a first-come, first-served basis\" so it's possible that an application will not make it into the program if the limit is hit.\nIf you registered your MyTravelGov account after 12:24 p.m. EDT on Saturday, you'll need to wait to submit your application until the program reopens next month.

Guests can swim in its indoor-outdoor pool during the day, and return for nighttime festivities when the pool turns into a stage. The space can\u00a0also host aerial performances, per the release.\nThere are other entertainment spaces as well, including the line's Piazza and the Princess Theater.\nDining and beverage options include\u00a0new coffee shop Coffee Currents, Bellini's Cocktail Bar,\u00a0Alfredo's Pizzeria and Crooners Bar.\nSun Princess was designed with accessibility in mind,\u00a0which Padgett said will feature in \"all the nuances of barriers and doors and thresholds and grades, and handles and placements,\" though the\u00a0line does not yet have a final number of accessible cabins on board.\nThe ship is also the first Princess vessel dual-fuel powered predominantly\u00a0by cleaner-burning liquefied natural gas.

Whether you're playing with a friend or competing in an official\u00a0Play! Pok\u00e9mon event, here is what you need to know to play Pok\u00e9mon.\u00a0\nHow many Pok\u00e9mon are there? We counted every generation of Pok\u00e9mon, including Arceus.\nJust curious?We're here to answer your everyday questions.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon trading card game's objective is to build the most powerful deck of Pok\u00e9mon and\u00a0battle by taking\u00a0turns using attacks and abilities to defeat your opponent.\u00a0Two players play at a time, each with a deck of 60 cards, says\u00a0the official Pok\u00e9mon website.\u00a0\nThe duration of each Pok\u00e9mon match depends on how quickly you can defeat your opponent, but play time can last for mere minutes or over one\u00a0hour. Official Pok\u00e9mon trading card game tournaments can even last over 12 hours.\nAccording to the official Pok\u00e9mon website, there are three types of cards in the Pok\u00e9mon trading card game:\u00a0\nCharacter cards have the actual Pok\u00e9mon on them. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a type, one of 11 in the trading card game. The types according to Bulbapedia:\nAlthough there are 18 types in the video games, this is condensed for the trading card game, such as Ice being categorized under Water or Ghost being classified as\u00a0Psychic.\u00a0\nAdditionally, there are two moves on the card, which can be attacks or abilities. To the right of these will be the amount of damage for each attack or ability. Any other damage or impacts will be listed underneath the individual move.\u00a0\nEach Pok\u00e9mon will be classified as a basic, stage 1 or stage 2. These denote a Pok\u00e9mon's evolution stage. For instance, a piplup card is considered \"Basic\" (since it is the first of the evolution line),\u00a0prinplup is \"stage 1\" (since it evolves from piplup) and empoleon is \"stage 2\" (since it evolves from\u00a0prinplup).\u00a0\nOn the card will also be its hit points (or HP), which denotes how much damage a Pok\u00e9mon can take before being knocked out. Also listed will be its weakness, resistance and retreat cost.\nWeakness will tell which types your Pok\u00e9mon is weak to and if additional damage is\u00a0given per move.\u00a0Resistance denotes which types your Pok\u00e9mon will receive less damage from.\nIf you wish to bring your active card back\u00a0and swap another in, this is where retreat cost comes into play. To pay, add the specified energy card amount.\u00a0\nA Pok\u00e9mon card worth 6 figures: A rare first edition Pok\u00e9mon card sells for more than $300,000 at auction\nWhat is the most expensive Pok\u00e9mon card? World record and 14 other rare cards.\nEnergy cards can be attached\u00a0onto your character cards to power up attacks. They are added below the character card and stay there until the an effect or action removes them.\u00a0\nNext to the attacks and abilities will be the attack cost, which signifies how many and\u00a0which type of energy you need to perform a move.\u00a0\nYou can\u00a0attach only one energy card per turn, matching the corresponding \u00a0energy symbol of the attack cost. A colorless energy symbol is considered a wild card, meaning you can add any type of energy card to execute\u00a0the attack.\nAccording to the official Pok\u00e9mon website, there are nine energy card types:\u00a0\nOnce a Pok\u00e9mon is retreated, the energy cards are discarded.\u00a0\nTrainer cards come in one of three types, each bringing a different\u00a0advantage:\u00a0\nItem cards are played during your turn. You can add as many as you want before\u00a0making an attack. On the card will be instructions for how it is\u00a0used. A Pok\u00e9mon tool card is a special item card that can be attached to your character card, giving it a special effect. Only one\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon tool\u00a0can be attached at a time. If a Pok\u00e9mon is attacked, the tool card goes into the discard pile.\u00a0\nSupporter cards can only be played once per turn, and they can really help in a game by giving extra advantages, such as healing damage from a Pok\u00e9mon or allowing you to discard your hand and redraw.\u00a0\nStadium cards remain active once played, and only one stadium can be played at a time. Each stadium card has its own rules. If you are looking to change the stadium, it must have a\u00a0different name than the one currently in play. Once a new one is added, discard the old one and its effects.\nPok\u00e9mon games: Every Pok\u00e9mon game ranked from worst to best\nWhen starting the Pok\u00e9mon trading card game, decide who goes first. This can be done by coin flip or rock-paper-scissors. The winner chooses who goes first.\u00a0If you are the first player to take a turn, you cannot play a supporter card or attack on your first turn.\u00a0\nShuffle your deck and draw the top seven cards. In order to start, you will need a basic Pok\u00e9mon in your hand. If you do not, you will have to mulligan.\u00a0\nWhen taking a mulligan, show your hand to your opponent and shuffle it back into the deck. Then draw seven new cards from the top. Repeat this until you have at least one basic character card in your hand.\u00a0\nYour opponent can choose to add one card to their hand for every mulligan you take. If both players have mulligans, subtract the higher amount from the lower total\u00a0and draw the remainder. For example, if player one took three mulligans and player two took four mulligans, player one gets to draw\u00a0one extra card to their hand.\u00a0\nOnce both players have basic Pok\u00e9mon, place the cards face down on the active spot of the play mat. If you have more than one basic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon in your hand, you can place up to five cards in your bench.\u00a0\nBefore officially starting, place facedown six cards from the top of your deck as prize cards.\u00a0\nLechonk, trainers and legendary Pok\u00e9mon: Here's what you need to know about\u00a0'Pok\u00e9mon: Scarlet' and 'Pok\u00e9mon: Violet'\nTo start, turn over the active and benched Pok\u00e9mon cards. Each player's turn is made of three parts:\u00a0\nFirst draw a card from your deck. From there, you can decide what action you wish to take, such as:\u00a0\nYou can do as many of the following actions before finally choosing to attack your opponent's active\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon. When attacking, make sure you have the correct amount of energy cards for the move. Tell your opponent which attack you are making. Then tally the damage and extra effects.\u00a0\nThe amount of damage a move does is listed to the right of the attack name. Your opponent should add damage counters to their card for the specified amount of damage. Damage counters are not removed from a card even if the Pok\u00e9mon evolves or is moved to the bench. The counters\u00a0can only be taken away if the Pok\u00e9mon is healed, knocked out or removed from play entirely.\u00a0\nIf a Pok\u00e9mon has total damage that is greater than or equal to its HP, it is knocked out. Remove the card and its attached cards to the discard pile.\u00a0\nAlternate turns until all of one player's prize cards are taken or all their Pok\u00e9mon are knocked out. The player left standing or receiving all the prize cards wins.\u00a0A player can also win if their opponent\u00a0has\u00a0no other cards left in their deck at the start of the turn.\u00a0\nFrom Mew to Mewtwo:\u00a0Every Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, ranked\nWhen you are playing the card game, the character cards can be placed in the active or benched section of the play mat.\u00a0\nAn active Pok\u00e9mon is used to attack your opponent's card. Only one card can be active per player at a time.\u00a0\nThe bench houses the other basic Pok\u00e9mon on your team, which can be swapped in to the active spot. A player can have up to five Pok\u00e9mon benched during a game.\u00a0If your active Pok\u00e9mon is knocked out or you choose to retreat it, move a different Pok\u00e9mon from your bench into the active spot.\u00a0\nOpinion:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon still has a hold on all of us. Will Nintendo's new game live up to the billion-dollar expectation?\nDuring a game, you may choose to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon to give it the\u00a0advantage of stronger attacks and higher HP. To evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, start with a basic character card of an evolution line, such as Eevee.\u00a0\nFrom there, choose the stage 1 card from the evolution line. A stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon evolves from a basic Pok\u00e9mon. A stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon evolves from a stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon. A Pok\u00e9mon cannot use the moves of its previous evolution, only the attacks and abilities listed on the evolved character card.\u00a0\nYou cannot evolve a Pok\u00e9mon if its card was just added to the bench, and you can only evolve once per turn.\u00a0Additionally, you cannot evolve on your first turn.\u00a0\nOnce a Pok\u00e9mon is evolved, it retains the damage counters and energy cards attached to it. However, if there are attack effects or special conditions on Pok\u00e9mon, such as being confused or poisoned, this goes away once it is evolved.\u00a0\nRanked:\u00a0The top ten Electric Pok\u00e9mon\nIn the clouds:\u00a0The top ten Flying Pok\u00e9mon, ranked\nEach player sets aside six prize cards which are awarded to the opponent once a round is won.

It\u2019s sleek, easy to use\u00a0and allows its owners to stay more attuned to their health and wellness.\nApple Watch Series 8, starting at $399, continues the tech giant\u2019s trend of spitting out polished and highly functional smartwatches. Having tried out the Series 8 for several days, I\u2019ve learned that more than ever, having the newest model really depends on exactly what you want from it.\nThe key addition this year is a wrist temperature sensor, which Apple said will help users who are cycle tracking. When you wear the Series 8 at night, it will measure your wrist temperature over five nights to determine your baseline temperature. Each night you wear it, the watch will keep tabs on any shifts in your body temperature.\nWhat was the first video game?:Detailing the first at-home video game, who invented it and more.\nApple iOS 16 is available now:What to know about latest software update for iPhone\nThe sensor can help people create ovulation estimates for family planning or to more accurately track periods. Once it gets to know the user\u2019s body, the watch can then send estimates whether a cycle deviates.\nBeyond that, the temperature sensor provides another health metric to help users stay up to date on any changes to their body.\nAlso, in light of concerns raised over data privacy following the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, Apple said\u00a0all cycle tracking data stays locked on your device and is encrypted.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also Crash Detection, an algorithm leveraging tools on the watch including the accelerometer and gyroscope to recognize when the wearer is involved in a serious crash. When it does detect a crash, it will check in with the wearer and call emergency services if they don\u2019t respond. Emergency responders and contacts will then receive the wearer\u2019s location.\nThe Series 8 is a great watch. Like the past two models, it boasts an always-on display that adjusts depending whether you're looking at the watch. So, you'll notice watch faces dim or turn darker when your wrist is down. It also features sensors for measuring blood oxygen and heart rate, and can take an electrocardiogram to measure heart activity directly from your wrist.\nSeries 8 is also comfy. The newly-added sleep stages introduced through WatchOS 9 give the watch more value at night. And just like previous models, it is a great fitness partner when working out.\u00a0Plus, battery life on Apple Watch is solid. You can easily get through a full day wearing one.\u00a0\nThat depends on what you want from an Apple Watch.\nCompared with last year's Series 7, the Series 8 feels like a similar watch. If you own a Series 7 or even a Series 6, don't fear missing out.\nAlso, keep in mind that WatchOS 9 covers Apple Watches going back to the Series 4, which means you get several great features such as the enhanced workouts and sleep stages.\nIf it's your first time owning a smartwatch, I'd consider the Apple Watch SE. I own a first-generation SE and it gives you 80% of what you want from the latest Apple Watch, minus the sensors for blood oxygen and temperature tracking and an always-on display. Plus, it's cheaper at $249.\nSo, who is the Apple Watch for? Maybe you want the peace of mind you get from Crash Detection (because hopefully, it's not a feature you'll need to use). Perhaps you want to take advantage of the temperature sensor for family planning. Maybe you have an older watch and it feels like the right time to upgrade.\nIn these cases, you're likely not going to find a better smartwatch.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/tech/2022/09/15/apple-watch-series-8-review/10385452002/", "title": "Apple Watch Series 8 review: Is it time for an upgrade?"}, {"authors": " Anna Kaufman", "date_publish": "Published: 6:00 a.m. ET Sept. 15, 2022 Updated: 6:19 a.m. ET Sept. 15, 2022", "description": "The video game market\u00a0is an important pillar of the modern entertainment industry.

At-home gaming is an increasingly popular pastime, with blockbuster names like \"Fortnite\" and \"Call of Duty\" captivating audiences.\nThe video game remains a relatively new invention, though, coming after television and film\u00a0and evolving rapidly in recent years.\u00a0\nWhat was the first-ever video game? Who invented it and when? Here's an inside look at video game history\u00a0from Atari's \"Pong\" to the more advanced consoles\u00a0of today.\u00a0\u00a0\nDiscover more Video Game coverage:Gaming news.\nGaming demographics:More adults play video games than kids \u2013 and more surprising stats.\nThe American Physics Society reports that in\u00a0October of 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham invented what is thought to be the first video game. However, there are some conflicting reports that earlier more rudimentary games should claim the title.\u00a0\nHiginbotham's game mimicked a tennis match and was called simply \"Tennis for Two.\"\u00a0It strongly resembles the video game \"Pong\" which rose to popularity \u00a0during the 1970s.\nHiginbotham was part of the\u00a0Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2019s instrumentation group, and worked with technician Robert Dvorak to build the game. Despite the pioneering nature of this invention, Higinbotham was not at heart a game designer. His work focused much more on Nuclear Arms Control.\u00a0\nPhysicist William Higinbotham is cited as the inventor of the first video game.\u00a0\nSanders Associates received the first patent for a video game in 1964 because\u00a0Higinbotham never patented his work.\u00a0\nVideo game pioneers:Before Nintendo and Atari: How a black engineer changed the video game industry forever.\nOctober 18, 1958. William Higinbotham's \"Tennis for Two\" was introduced at Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual visitors days.\u00a0\nHiginbotham's game only lasted for two years, though; video game systems which more closely resemble what we use today\u00a0became much more popular with a wider audience in the 1970s.\u00a0\nNo, despite popular belief, Pong, a video game designed by Atari, is not the first video game. However, according to The Museum of Play, it is the first video game to capture \"wide-scale public attention.\"\u00a0\nThe game mimics Ping-Pong, hence the name, and appeared first in\u00a0coin-operated arcade-style form at bars and restaurants.\u00a0\nIn 1975, Atari introduced an at-home version of the game in the\u00a0 Sears Catalog. The game became wildly popular.\u00a0\nThat first version of Pong\u00a0was tested as a prototype in a Sunnyvale, California bar called Andy Capp\u2019s Tavern.\u00a0\nVideo game characters ranked:10 Best\u00a0of all time.\nThe original arcade-style version of \"Pong\" came out in 1972. Three years later in 1975, Atari unveiled that play-at-home version called \"Home Pong.\"\u00a0\nThe idea for the game came from\u00a0Atari founder Nolan Bushnell. \u00a0Engineer Allan Alcorn was tasked with making it a reality.\u00a0\nThough Sanders Associates received the first patent for a video game in 1964, gaming company Magnavox purchased the patent from them and began producing\u00a0video game systems in the early 1970s.\nTrouble shooting:How to reduce video game input lag.\nThe Computer Museum of America reports that\u00a0Magnavox\u2019s Odyssey console was the first ever. It was introduced to North American markets\u00a0in September of 1972.\u00a0\nNowhere near as sleek as the gaming systems we have today, the somewhat clunky looking Odyssey, in tradition with early gaming, offered a ping-pong style game.\u00a0\nOf note, Atari's\u00a0Atari 2600, introduced in 1977, came with joysticks and\u00a0game cartridges that played multi-colored games, according to The History Channel. The revolutionary nature of this console kicked off a new wave of video game systems.\u00a0\nTechnically, Pac-Man is the oldest video game character. Screenrant reports that this pellet-eating arcade creature, born in 1980, is the grandfather of all video game characters.\u00a0\nNot far behind is Mario, introduced in 1981 in arcade form. Since then, he's gone on to an illustrious career in the gaming world.\u00a0\nPac-Man's legacy lives on:A lesson in pop culture iconography as Pac-Man turns 40.\nThe history of Nintendo\u00a0dates back many years. The company was founded by\u00a0Fusajiro Yamauchi in 1889 as a manufacturer of\u00a0\"Hanafuda\" or flower cards.\u00a0\nNearly 100 years later, in 1978\u00a0Nintendo released a simple \"arcade cocktail table game\" based on the board game Othello. It was called\u00a0\"Computer Othello.\" A year later the company broke ground on\u00a0Nintendo of America located in\u00a0New York City and started an operations division for coin-operated games.\nNot\u00a0the oldest video game character, but certainly among the most famous\u00a0is Sonic the Hedgehog, a creation of video game company Sega.\u00a0\nThe first version of Sonic was introduced in 1991, making the hedgehog 31 (a millennial).\u00a0\u00a0\nSonic the Hedgehog's wardrobe:His suit gets a spotlight.\n\"Home Pong\" was one of the first\u00a0popular at-home video games. It kicked off a boom in the mid-70s, shifting the video game industry from arcade-style systems to at-home consoles.\u00a0\nWe've come a long way since the early consoles of the mid-70s. Such a long way, in fact, that astronauts have taken video games to space.\u00a0\nIn the summer of 1993, Russian Astronaut\u00a0Aleksandr A. Serebrov took a Game Boy along on his space mission. While in orbit, Serebrov reported playing Nintendo's \"Tetris.\"\u00a0\nJust Curious?:Your everyday questions, answered.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com//story/tech/2022/09/15/what-was-the-first-oldest-video-game/8021599001/", "title": "What was the first video game?
